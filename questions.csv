question,answer,explanation
"Your client Megacorp has 235 permanent employees, but, in accordance with the recommendations of Modern Consulting Corporation, it also has 567 temporary employees who have no benefits. Megacorp qualifies as a Small Entity.","False","A small entity must have 500 or fewer employees total. Megacorp has 235 permanent + 567 temporary = 802 employees, exceeding the limit."
"The offer of a license to an invention prior to filing a patent application is considered prior art under AIA 102(a)(l).","False","The USPTO has determined that a license that merely grants rights under a patent cannot trigger the on-sale bar. An offer to enter into a license for future sale of an invention is not considered an offer to sell the patented invention."
"A patent is precluded under AIA 102 if the claimed invention was patented, described in a printed publication, or in public use, on sale, or otherwise available to the public more than 12 months before the effective filing date of the claimed invention.","True","This accurately describes the prior art captured under pre-AIA 102(b). The AIA changes made more, not less, things considered prior art."
"A patent is always precluded under AIA 102 if the claimed invention was patented, described in a printed publication, or in public use, on sale, or otherwise available to the public before the effective filing date of the claimed invention.","False","There is a limited exception under 102(b) for inventors. While narrow and not to be relied upon, it does exist, making it incorrect to say a patent is 'always precluded' in this circumstance."
"Secret sale or use activity does not qualify as prior art under AIA 102(a)(l).","True","The USPTO interprets the 'or otherwise available to the public' clause of AIA 102(a)(1) to indicate that secret sale or use activity does not qualify as prior art."
"In order to establish entitlement to an exception under AIA 102(b)(l)(B), the applicant must file an affidavit under Rule 1.131.","False","A Rule 1.131 affidavit is used to swear behind a reference in pre-AIA novelty rejections. For AIA 102(b) exceptions, applicants file an affidavit under 37 C.F.R. 1.130."
"If a U.S. patent, U.S. patent application publication, or WIPO-published application claims priority to one or more prior-filed foreign or international applications under 35 U.S.C. 119 or 365, the patent or published application will be considered effectively filed on the filing date of the earliest such application that describes the subject matter.","True","Under AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(d), a foreign filing date can be the prior art date for a reference if the patent or application is entitled to claim right of priority under various sections (35 USC 119, 365(a), 365(b), etc.)."
"A disclosure that would otherwise qualify as prior art under AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2) may be disqualified as prior art if the subject matter disclosed was obtained directly or indirectly from the inventor or a joint inventor.","True","The exception limits using an inventor's own work as prior art when disclosed in a U.S. patent, published application, or WIPO publication by another who obtained it directly or indirectly from the inventor."
"37 CFR 1.130 provides for the disqualification of a disclosure as prior art on the basis of attribution or a prior public disclosure of the inventor's or a joint inventor's own work.","True","37 CFR 1.130 allows for disqualification of a disclosure as prior art based on attribution or prior public disclosure of the inventor's own work under AIA 102(b)."
"In order for an applicant to be entitled to the exception under AIA 102(b)(l)(B), the mode of disclosure by an inventor or joint inventor must be the same as the mode of disclosure of an intervening disclosure.","False","There is no requirement that the mode of disclosure by an inventor be the same as the mode of an intervening disclosure (e.g., trade show vs. journal publication)."
"There is no requirement that the disclosure by the inventor or a joint inventor be a verbatim or 'ipsissimis verbis' ('close to verbatim') disclosure of the intervening grace period disclosure.","True","The USPTO has stated there is no requirement for the inventor's disclosure to be verbatim or 'ipsissimis verbis' of an intervening disclosure for the exception to apply."
"Failure to respond to a Notice of Omitted Items will result in the application being abandoned.","True","You must respond in some way to a Notice of Omitted Items or the application will go abandoned, even if not with a substantive response."
"Divisions and continuations of design applications can be filed as a Continued Prosecution Application (CPA) under Rule 1.53(d).","True","A continuation or divisional application may be filed under 37 CFR l.53(d) if the prior nonprovisional application is a design application that is complete."
"A provisional application is not complete until a cover sheet is submitted.","True","Per 37 C.F.R. l.53(c)(l), a provisional application must include a cover sheet. Without one, the application is treated as a nonprovisional application."
"A certified copy of the foreign application must be filed within the later of four months from the actual filing date of the application or 16 months from the filing date of the prior foreign application, unless the filing of the certified copy is otherwise accepted.","True","Per 37 C.F.R. l.55(f), certified copies must be filed within the later of 4 months from filing or 16 months from prior foreign application, with exceptions in Rules 55(h) and 55(i)."
"Your client John Huang advised you today that he can claim priority from an application filed in India last year, and provides you with a certified copy of the Indian application. Unfortunately, the issue fee was paid last week. Priority can still be claimed provided that the priority papers are accompanied by the required fee under 37 CFR 1.55. However, the claim for priority will not be printed on the patent. Instead, the claim for priority will be reviewed and corrected by a Certificate of Correction.","True","This is true if the applicant can demonstrate the delay in submitting the priority claim was unintentional, per 37 C.F.R. l.55(e)."
"The expiration date for a U.S. patent filed June 8, 1995, which is a division of an earlier abandoned application, is June 8, 2015.","False","For applications filed on or after June 8, 1995, the patent term is 20 years from the filing date of the earliest application to which it claims priority, not the divisional filing date."
"Non-confidential Records not disclosed to the public as part of the regular informational activity of the Patent Office may be requested under the Freedom of Information Act.","True","As part of the U.S. government, the USPTO must comply with FOIA requirements (5 U.S.C. 552)."
"Shawna filed a provisional application on October 13, 2010. A design application was filed on September 23, 2011. The design application was replaced by a continuation on July 3, 2012. The earliest effective U.S. filing date for the continuation is October 13, 2010 and the 102(e) or 102(a)(2) date for any patent that issues from the continuation is October 13, 2010.","False","A design application cannot claim priority from a provisional application according to 35 U.S.C. 172."
"The presentation of any paper, whether by filing, signing, or submitting, constitutes certification under 37 CFR 11.18(b).","True","By filing papers with the USPTO, the party is certifying that contents are based on their knowledge, are true and accurate, not for improper purposes, legal arguments are warranted, and factual assertions have support."
"Failure to record an assignment will result in that assignment being null and void.","False","There is no requirement that assignments be recorded, and failure to record does not affect the validity of the assignment. Recording only protects against subsequent bona fide purchasers."
"The recording of a document is not a determination by the Office of the validity of the document or the effect that document has on the title to an application.","True","The Patent Office merely records the document provided without determining its validity or effect on title to an application, patent, or registration."
"Errors in recording assignments can be corrected, and no new recording fee is required.","False","A corrective document will be recorded and given a new reel and frame number and recording date. A new recording fee is required for each patent application against which the corrective document is being recorded."
"Access to the entire contents of a pending unpublished application incorporated by reference into an issued patent can be obtained without notice to the owner of that application.","False","Only a copy of the application as filed can be obtained without notice, per Rule 1.14(a)(1)(vi)."
"An abandoned provisional patent application relied upon for priority in a nonprovisional U.S. patent application is available to the public upon written request and payment of a fee.","True","Per 37 C.F.R. 1.14(a)(1)(iv), abandoned provisional applications relied upon for priority can be accessed by the public with a written request and fee."
"A petition to withdraw from representing a client in an application is effective upon filing.","False","According to 37 C.F.R. 1.36(b), a petition to withdraw is effective only upon the petition being granted, not upon filing."
"Every U.S.-origin application filed in the USPTO is considered to include an implicit petition for a foreign filing license.","True","According to MPEP 140, every patent application contains an implicit request for a foreign filing license, which is granted automatically after 6 months if no secrecy order is imposed."
"A person may not execute a substitute statement unless they have reviewed and understood the contents of the application.","True","Per 37 C.F.R. 1.64 and 1.56, since the person executing the substitute statement is doing so in lieu of the inventor, they must review and understand the application contents."
"An inventor can be added to a provisional application under 37 CFR 1.48.","True","Once a cover sheet is submitted, inventorship in a provisional patent application can be corrected. The request must identify each inventor by legal name and requires a Patent Office fee."
"While only the assignee of record of the entire interest can intervene in the prosecution of an application, an assignee of a part interest or a licensee of an exclusive right is entitled to inspect the application.","True","Only the assignee of record of the entire interest can intervene in prosecution, while part-interest assignees or exclusive licensees are entitled only to inspect the application."
"A foreign filing license is not required to file a design application overseas, even if the design was invented in the U.S.","False","According to MPEP 140, a foreign filing license is always required if the invention is conceived in the United States, including for design patents."
"An assignment may be filed for recording at the same time as the patent application is filed, provided that the date of execution of the application, the identity of the inventors, and the title of the application are set forth in the assignment.","True","Per MPEP 302.03, an assignment executed before filing must identify the patent application by inventor names and invention title to be properly recorded."
"Where there is an assignee or the invention is subject to an obligation to assign, the American Inventors Act (AIA) requires the assignee to make the application for patent in the United States.","False","35 U.S.C. 118 permits, but does not require, the assignee to make the application for patent."
"An applicant may execute a substitute statement in lieu of an oath or declaration if the inventor cannot be found or reached after diligent effort.","True","Per 37 C.F.R. 1.64, a substitute statement can be used if the inventor is deceased, under legal incapacity, has refused to execute the oath/declaration, or cannot be found after diligent effort."
"A substitute statement does not need to identify the circumstances leading to the unavailability of the inventor, but rather may merely state the applicant is the assignee and owns 100% of the right, title and interest in the claimed invention.","False","According to 37 C.F.R. 1.64, a substitute statement must identify the specific circumstances permitting its use (death, incapacity, cannot be found, or refusal)."
"An inventor who protests his or her designation as an inventor is not entitled to inspect the file or to participate in subsequent prosecution.","False","Per MPEP 409.03(i), a nonsigning inventor may protest their designation, is entitled to inspect application papers, order copies, and make their position of record in the application."
"Your client MegaCorp has merged with its large competitor MegaGiant. The certificate of merger is not recordable in the USPTO because it does not affect title.","False","According to MPEP 314, certificates showing business name changes or mergers are recordable. Although a mere name change does not change legal entity, it is properly a link in the chain of title."
"A non-exclusive licensee may not record the license agreement.","False","Per MPEP 313, license agreements and documents conveying security interests can be recorded even though they do not constitute a transfer or change of title."
"A resident alien may be given limited recognition to prosecute a specific application or applications upon a showing of circumstance that it is necessary or justifiable.","True","Per 37 C.F.R. 11.9(b), a nonimmigrant alien residing in the US may be granted limited recognition if authorized by immigration authorities to represent patent applicants."
"Registered attorneys or agents who are not of record in the file may not file papers in a patent application.","False","Registered patent practitioners may file papers in patent applications even when not of record. This is considered representation that they are authorized to act on behalf of the applicant."
"Inventors may make an application jointly even if they did not work together or at the same time.","True","Per 37 C.F.R. 1.45(b), inventors may apply for a patent jointly even if they did not physically work together, did not work at the same time, did not make the same type or amount of contribution, or did not contribute to every claim."
"Your client John Brown has an application which has been pending for six months. Because the technology is not very active you have already received a Notice of Allowance and paid the issue fee. Because the application has been pending less than one year, it can be converted into a provisional application.","False","Per 37 C.F.R. 1.53(c)(2), a nonprovisional application may be converted to provisional if done before payment of the issue fee. Since the issue fee has already been paid, conversion is no longer possible."
"You received a first Official Action from the Patent Office dated July 14, 2018 and setting a three month shortened statutory period for response. Without consulting you, your client writes a letter to the USPTO accusing the Examiner of being prejudiced against independent inventors, and canceling all of the claims. The USPTO returned the letter to your client. On September 30, 2018, you file a response to the action and a Notice of Appeal. The rejection will now be reviewed by the Board of Appeals.","False","Per 37 C.F.R. 41.31(a)(1), an applicant may appeal only when claims have been twice rejected. Here, the claims have only been rejected once, so an appeal is not yet possible."
"Wilbur is an employee of Megacorp and has signed an agreement to assign any and all inventions he might make while working for the company. Wilburs new toy invention is the subject of a patent application. Wilburs wife works for a joint venture between Megacorp and a Swedish company. She has no obligation to assign any right. After learning from Wilbur of his invention, she made an important but obvious improvement to Wilburs toy. Her improvement, if kept secret, is prior art under AIA 102 to any application filed and directed to Wilburs toy.","False","Secret activity does not qualify as prior art. The USPTO views the or otherwise available to the public clause of AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1) as indicating that secret sale or use activity does not qualify as prior art."
"A provisional rejection for double patenting and a provisional rejection under pre-AIA 102(a)(2) cannot be made in the same Office Action.","False","Both provisional double patenting rejections and provisional 102(a)(2) rejections can be made in the same Office Action. The former relates to claims and the latter to disclosure, making it possible for both rejections to coexist."
"A nonprovisional application filed with only one claim can be converted into a provisional application.","True","Per 37 C.F.R. 1.53(c)(2), a nonprovisional patent application may be converted to a provisional application and be accorded the original filing date of the previously filed application."
"An Information Disclosure Statement must include a translation of any references that anticipate any claims.","False","Per MPEP 609, for non-English documents, the applicant must supply either a concise explanation of relevance OR a written English translation. A translation is optional, not required."
"A final rejection is mailed on January 5, 2018 setting a shortened three-month period for response. On Monday, April 7, 2018 a response is filed together with a request for a one-month extension of time. The response is refused entry by an advisory action dated May 14, 2018. A Notice of Appeal is filed three days after the advisory action is received. The deadline for filing an appeal brief is two months from the date of mailing of the advisory action.","False","Per 37 C.F.R. 41.37(a), the deadline for filing an appeal brief is two months from the receipt of the Notice of Appeal, not two months from the date the advisory action is mailed."
"An application filed on June 13, 1994 is replaced by a continuation filed June 10, 1995. The continuation issued on April 14, 1997. The patent will expire on June 13, 2014.","True","For applications with priority to pre-June 8, 1995 filings, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest priority filing date. Since the parent was filed June 13, 1994, the patent expires June 13, 2014 (assuming maintenance fees are paid)."
"An IDS is timely if filed within three months from the filing of a provisional application.","False","Per 37 C.F.R. 1.51(d), you do not file an IDS in a provisional patent application. Provisional applications are not examined and do not require claims."
"An application is filed with 11 claims. Claim 1 is independent, claim 2 depends from claim 1, and claim 3 states in the preamble that it depends from claims 1 and 2. Claim 4 likewise is independent, and claim 5 depends from claim 1 or claim 4. Claim 6 depends from claim 5. Claim 7 is independent and claim 8-11 each depend from claim 7. The total number of claims for calculating fees is 12.","False","The number is 13. Claim 3 counts as only one claim because it is an improper multiple dependent claim, claim 5 counts for two claims, and claim 6 counts for two claims since it depends on 5 which counts twice. All other claims count once."
"A CIP of a design application can be filed under either Rule 1.53(b) or 1.53(d).","False","Since no new matter may be introduced in a CPA (Continued Prosecution Application) under 37 CFR 1.53(d), this procedure is not available for filing a continuation-in-part application. All CIPs must be filed under 37 CFR 1.53(b)."
"Your client has invented a device for detecting bombs on aircrafts. A U.S. application directed to this invention can be advanced out of turn without payment of a fee because it will combat terrorism.","True","Per 37 C.F.R. 1.102(c), a petition to make an application special may be filed without a fee if the invention will contribute to countering terrorism, though Accelerated Examination requirements still apply."
"A utility application replacing a provisional application can be filed on the last day of pendency of the provisional by Express Mail on Saturday, Sunday, or a holiday, or it can be filed by Express Mail the next day the PTO is open for business.","True","A provisional application remains pending to the next succeeding business day if the 12-month date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday within the District of Columbia."
"If an EFS submission is successfully received (even on a Saturday, Sunday or Federal holiday within the District of Columbia), the USPTO will assign that receipt date to the submission.","True","For applications submitted through EFS-Web, the USPTO assigns the receipt date even if submitted on weekends or holidays. The date is based on Eastern Standard Time when the USPTO received the submission."
"If the application does not contain anything that can be construed as a written description, the Patent Office will mail a Notice of Incomplete Application indicating that the application lacks the specification required by 35 U.S.C. 112, but a filing date will be granted if the applicant responds timely.","False","While the USPTO will mail a Notice of Incomplete Application, no filing date will be granted if there is no written description that can be construed as a specification."
"The applicant may file a Request for Continued Examination (RCE) at any point during the pendency of the application by filing an appropriate submission and the required fee.","False","Per 37 C.F.R. 114(a), prosecution must be closed before an RCE can be filed. This occurs when the application is under appeal, after a final action, notice of allowance, or other action that closes prosecution."
"Upon request of the applicant in a newly filed utility or plant patent application, the USPTO may grant a deferral of examination for a period not extending beyond three years from the earliest filing date for which a benefit is claimed.","True","Per 37 C.F.R. 1.103(d), the Office may grant deferral of examination for up to three years from the earliest priority date. The request must include the publication fee."
"A submission as used in 37 C.F.R. 1.114 includes, but is not limited to, an information disclosure statement, an amendment to the written description, claims, or drawings, new arguments, or new evidence in support of patentability.","True","Per 37 CFR 1.114(c), a submission includes IDS, amendments to specification/claims/drawings, new arguments, or new evidence supporting patentability."
"Becoming a patent attorney is worth the incredible stress, work and anxiety of this Exam.","True",""
"A timely reply brief can be filed in every appeal following the Examiners Answer.","True","Per 37 C.F.R. 41.41, an appellant may file a single reply brief to an examiners answer within the later of two months from the date of either the examiners answer or a decision refusing to grant a petition to designate a new ground of rejection."
"A request for supplemental examination of a patent must be filed by the owner or owners of the entire right, title, and interest in the patent.","True","Per 37 C.F.R. 1.601(a), only the patent owner with complete ownership interest may file for supplemental examination. Third parties are prohibited from filing papers or participating in any manner."
"The Examiner telephoned you today and asked that you make an election between two inventions. You advised the Examiner that you did not wish to make such an election and asked for a written requirement. The Examiner will now hold the application as abandoned.","False","Per MPEP 812.01, if the patent attorney objects to making an oral election or fails to respond, a restriction letter will be mailed. The case will not be deemed abandoned."
"The following are bases for filing a reissue 1) the claims are too narrow or too broad, 2) the disclosure contains inaccuracies, 3) the applicant failed to or incorrectly claimed foreign priority, and 4) the application failed to make reference to or incorrectly made reference to prior co-pending applications.","True","Per MPEP 1402, these are the most common bases for filing a reissue application, which is done to correct an error of one kind or another."
"Canceled matter in U.S. patent files is not prior art as of the filing date of the application under 102(a)(2).","True","Canceled matter in the application file of a U.S. patent or publication is not a proper reference as of the filing date. However, such matter may be used as prior art as of the patent or publication date."
"Acts proving inventorship within Canada can be used to establish an ex parte pre-AIA 102(g) rejection of a pending application provided those acts took place after December 8, 1993.","False","Acts in foreign countries can never be the basis of a pre-AIA 102(g) rejection except during an interference."
"Claims in a reissue application can be rejected only on the basis of prior patents and publications.","False","Per 37 CFR 1.176, a reissue application is examined in the same manner as a non-reissue application. Claims are subject to any and all rejections the examiner deems appropriate, not just those based on prior patents and publications."
"After having received the international search report, the applicant has the opportunity to amend the claims of the international application by filing amendments with the International Bureau.","True","Per PCT Article 19 and MPEP 1853, after issuance of the Search Report, the applicant has one opportunity to amend claims by filing directly with the International Bureau, usually within 2 months of the Search Report mailing date."
"You receive a Notice of Allowance on May 14, 2018. The issue fee is paid on Monday, August 16, 2018 together with a request for a one-month extension of time and the proper fee. The first day that the application is abandoned is May 15, 2018.","False","An issue fee payment period cannot be extended. However, since August 14, 2018 was a Saturday (as implied by August 16 being Monday), the payment was timely as requirements falling on weekends can be completed the next business day."
"An application abandoned more than five years cannot be revived.","False","Per 37 C.F.R. 1.137, there is no time limit on reviving an abandoned application."
"An Examiners Answer cannot contain a new ground of rejection.","False","Per 37 CFR 41.39, an examiners answer may include a new ground of rejection. Any rejection using evidence not relied upon in the Office action from which the appeal is taken must be designated as a new ground of rejection."
"The Patent Office will accept color photographs in a utility application only after the granting of a petition and payment of a fee.","True","Per Rule 1.84, the Office will accept color drawings in utility patent applications only after granting a petition explaining why color drawings are necessary, along with the required fee, three sets of color drawings, and specification amendment."
"While information in the specification, claims, drawings, and any preliminary amendment specifically incorporated into an executed oath or declaration will not be expunged, a petition may be filed and a fee paid requesting expunging other material and returning it to the applicant.","True","Per Rule 1.59, information forming part of the original disclosure will not be expunged, but an applicant may request that the Office expunge other information by filing a petition."
"A patent expired for unintentional failure to pay the maintenance cannot be revived after three years.","False","The Patent Law Treaties Implementation Act (PLTIA) has eliminated any time period for properly filing a petition to accept an unintentionally delayed maintenance fee payment."
"A continuation or division filed under Rule 1.53(b) can be filed with a copy of the original oath or declaration.","True","Per Rule 1.53(b), since neither continuation nor divisional applications contain new matter, a copy of the original oath or declaration will suffice."
"A request for supplemental examination of a patent may only be filed until the patent has expired.","False","Per 37 C.F.R. 1.601(c), a request for supplemental examination may be filed at any time during the period of enforceability of the patent."
"An exclusive licensee may file papers or otherwise participate in a supplemental examination proceeding.","False","Per 37 C.F.R. 1.601(b), any party other than the patent owner is prohibited from filing papers or participating in any manner in a supplemental examination proceeding."
"Interviews are permitted in a supplemental examination proceeding.","False","Per 37 C.F.R. 1.620(e), interviews are prohibited in a supplemental examination proceeding."
"Amendment may not be filed in a supplemental examination proceeding.","True","Per 37 C.F.R. 1.620(f), no amendment may be filed in a supplemental examination proceeding."
"The request for supplemental examination must include an explanation of why each item of information submitted raises a substantial new question of patentability.","False","Per 37 C.F.R. 1.610(c), this is not a required item. The request may, but need not, include an explanation of why each item of information does or does not raise a substantial new question of patentability."
