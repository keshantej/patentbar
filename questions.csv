question,answer,explanation
"Your client Megacorp has 235 permanent employees, but, in accordance with the recommendations of Modern Consulting Corporation, it also has 567 temporary employees who have no benefits. Megacorp qualifies as a Small Entity.","False","A small entity must have 500 or fewer employees total. Megacorp has 235 permanent + 567 temporary = 802 employees, exceeding the limit."
"The offer of a license to an invention prior to filing a patent application is considered prior art under AIA 102(a)(l).","False","The USPTO has determined that a license that merely grants rights under a patent cannot trigger the on-sale bar. An offer to enter into a license for future sale of an invention is not considered an offer to sell the patented invention."
"A patent is precluded under AIA 102 if the claimed invention was patented, described in a printed publication, or in public use, on sale, or otherwise available to the public more than 12 months before the effective filing date of the claimed invention.","True","This accurately describes the prior art captured under pre-AIA 102(b). The AIA changes made more, not less, things considered prior art."
"A patent is always precluded under AIA 102 if the claimed invention was patented, described in a printed publication, or in public use, on sale, or otherwise available to the public before the effective filing date of the claimed invention.","False","There is a limited exception under 102(b) for inventors. While narrow and not to be relied upon, it does exist, making it incorrect to say a patent is 'always precluded' in this circumstance."
"Secret sale or use activity does not qualify as prior art under AIA 102(a)(l).","True","The USPTO interprets the 'or otherwise available to the public' clause of AIA 102(a)(1) to indicate that secret sale or use activity does not qualify as prior art."
"In order to establish entitlement to an exception under AIA 102(b)(l)(B), the applicant must file an affidavit under Rule 1.131.","False","A Rule 1.131 affidavit is used to swear behind a reference in pre-AIA novelty rejections. For AIA 102(b) exceptions, applicants file an affidavit under 37 C.F.R. 1.130."
"If a U.S. patent, U.S. patent application publication, or WIPO-published application claims priority to one or more prior-filed foreign or international applications under 35 U.S.C. 119 or 365, the patent or published application will be considered effectively filed on the filing date of the earliest such application that describes the subject matter.","True","Under AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(d), a foreign filing date can be the prior art date for a reference if the patent or application is entitled to claim right of priority under various sections (35 USC 119, 365(a), 365(b), etc.)."
"A disclosure that would otherwise qualify as prior art under AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2) may be disqualified as prior art if the subject matter disclosed was obtained directly or indirectly from the inventor or a joint inventor.","True","The exception limits using an inventor's own work as prior art when disclosed in a U.S. patent, published application, or WIPO publication by another who obtained it directly or indirectly from the inventor."
"37 CFR 1.130 provides for the disqualification of a disclosure as prior art on the basis of attribution or a prior public disclosure of the inventor's or a joint inventor's own work.","True","37 CFR 1.130 allows for disqualification of a disclosure as prior art based on attribution or prior public disclosure of the inventor's own work under AIA 102(b)."
"In order for an applicant to be entitled to the exception under AIA 102(b)(l)(B), the mode of disclosure by an inventor or joint inventor must be the same as the mode of disclosure of an intervening disclosure.","False","There is no requirement that the mode of disclosure by an inventor be the same as the mode of an intervening disclosure (e.g., trade show vs. journal publication)."
"There is no requirement that the disclosure by the inventor or a joint inventor be a verbatim or 'ipsissimis verbis' ('close to verbatim') disclosure of the intervening grace period disclosure.","True","The USPTO has stated there is no requirement for the inventor's disclosure to be verbatim or 'ipsissimis verbis' of an intervening disclosure for the exception to apply."
"Failure to respond to a Notice of Omitted Items will result in the application being abandoned.","True","You must respond in some way to a Notice of Omitted Items or the application will go abandoned, even if not with a substantive response."
"Divisions and continuations of design applications can be filed as a Continued Prosecution Application (CPA) under Rule 1.53(d).","True","A continuation or divisional application may be filed under 37 CFR l.53(d) if the prior nonprovisional application is a design application that is complete."
"A provisional application is not complete until a cover sheet is submitted.","True","Per 37 C.F.R. l.53(c)(l), a provisional application must include a cover sheet. Without one, the application is treated as a nonprovisional application."
"A certified copy of the foreign application must be filed within the later of four months from the actual filing date of the application or 16 months from the filing date of the prior foreign application, unless the filing of the certified copy is otherwise accepted.","True","Per 37 C.F.R. l.55(f), certified copies must be filed within the later of 4 months from filing or 16 months from prior foreign application, with exceptions in Rules 55(h) and 55(i)."
"Your client John Huang advised you today that he can claim priority from an application filed in India last year, and provides you with a certified copy of the Indian application. Unfortunately, the issue fee was paid last week. Priority can still be claimed provided that the priority papers are accompanied by the required fee under 37 CFR 1.55. However, the claim for priority will not be printed on the patent. Instead, the claim for priority will be reviewed and corrected by a Certificate of Correction.","True","This is true if the applicant can demonstrate the delay in submitting the priority claim was unintentional, per 37 C.F.R. l.55(e)."
"The expiration date for a U.S. patent filed June 8, 1995, which is a division of an earlier abandoned application, is June 8, 2015.","False","For applications filed on or after June 8, 1995, the patent term is 20 years from the filing date of the earliest application to which it claims priority, not the divisional filing date."
"Non-confidential Records not disclosed to the public as part of the regular informational activity of the Patent Office may be requested under the Freedom of Information Act.","True","As part of the U.S. government, the USPTO must comply with FOIA requirements (5 U.S.C. 552)."
"Shawna filed a provisional application on October 13, 2010. A design application was filed on September 23, 2011. The design application was replaced by a continuation on July 3, 2012. The earliest effective U.S. filing date for the continuation is October 13, 2010 and the 102(e) or 102(a)(2) date for any patent that issues from the continuation is October 13, 2010.","False","A design application cannot claim priority from a provisional application according to 35 U.S.C. 172."
"The presentation of any paper, whether by filing, signing, or submitting, constitutes certification under 37 CFR 11.18(b).","True","By filing papers with the USPTO, the party is certifying that contents are based on their knowledge, are true and accurate, not for improper purposes, legal arguments are warranted, and factual assertions have support."
"Failure to record an assignment will result in that assignment being null and void.","False","There is no requirement that assignments be recorded, and failure to record does not affect the validity of the assignment. Recording only protects against subsequent bona fide purchasers."
"The recording of a document is not a determination by the Office of the validity of the document or the effect that document has on the title to an application.","True","The Patent Office merely records the document provided without determining its validity or effect on title to an application, patent, or registration."
"Errors in recording assignments can be corrected, and no new recording fee is required.","False","A corrective document will be recorded and given a new reel and frame number and recording date. A new recording fee is required for each patent application against which the corrective document is being recorded."
"Access to the entire contents of a pending unpublished application incorporated by reference into an issued patent can be obtained without notice to the owner of that application.","False","Only a copy of the application as filed can be obtained without notice, per Rule 1.14(a)(1)(vi)."
"An abandoned provisional patent application relied upon for priority in a nonprovisional U.S. patent application is available to the public upon written request and payment of a fee.","True","Per 37 C.F.R. 1.14(a)(1)(iv), abandoned provisional applications relied upon for priority can be accessed by the public with a written request and fee."
"A petition to withdraw from representing a client in an application is effective upon filing.","False","According to 37 C.F.R. 1.36(b), a petition to withdraw is effective only upon the petition being granted, not upon filing."
"Every U.S.-origin application filed in the USPTO is considered to include an implicit petition for a foreign filing license.","True","According to MPEP 140, every patent application contains an implicit request for a foreign filing license, which is granted automatically after 6 months if no secrecy order is imposed."
"A person may not execute a substitute statement unless they have reviewed and understood the contents of the application.","True","Per 37 C.F.R. 1.64 and 1.56, since the person executing the substitute statement is doing so in lieu of the inventor, they must review and understand the application contents."
"An inventor can be added to a provisional application under 37 CFR 1.48.","True","Once a cover sheet is submitted, inventorship in a provisional patent application can be corrected. The request must identify each inventor by legal name and requires a Patent Office fee."
"While only the assignee of record of the entire interest can intervene in the prosecution of an application, an assignee of a part interest or a licensee of an exclusive right is entitled to inspect the application.","True","Only the assignee of record of the entire interest can intervene in prosecution, while part-interest assignees or exclusive licensees are entitled only to inspect the application."
"A foreign filing license is not required to file a design application overseas, even if the design was invented in the U.S.","False","According to MPEP 140, a foreign filing license is always required if the invention is conceived in the United States, including for design patents."
"An assignment may be filed for recording at the same time as the patent application is filed, provided that the date of execution of the application, the identity of the inventors, and the title of the application are set forth in the assignment.","True","Per MPEP 302.03, an assignment executed before filing must identify the patent application by inventor names and invention title to be properly recorded."
"Where there is an assignee or the invention is subject to an obligation to assign, the American Inventors Act (AIA) requires the assignee to make the application for patent in the United States.","False","35 U.S.C. 118 permits, but does not require, the assignee to make the application for patent."
"An applicant may execute a substitute statement in lieu of an oath or declaration if the inventor cannot be found or reached after diligent effort.","True","Per 37 C.F.R. 1.64, a substitute statement can be used if the inventor is deceased, under legal incapacity, has refused to execute the oath/declaration, or cannot be found after diligent effort."
"A substitute statement does not need to identify the circumstances leading to the unavailability of the inventor, but rather may merely state the applicant is the assignee and owns 100% of the right, title and interest in the claimed invention.","False","According to 37 C.F.R. 1.64, a substitute statement must identify the specific circumstances permitting its use (death, incapacity, cannot be found, or refusal)."
"An inventor who protests his or her designation as an inventor is not entitled to inspect the file or to participate in subsequent prosecution.","False","Per MPEP 409.03(i), a nonsigning inventor may protest their designation, is entitled to inspect application papers, order copies, and make their position of record in the application."
"Your client MegaCorp has merged with its large competitor MegaGiant. The certificate of merger is not recordable in the USPTO because it does not affect title.","False","According to MPEP 314, certificates showing business name changes or mergers are recordable. Although a mere name change does not change legal entity, it is properly a link in the chain of title."
"A non-exclusive licensee may not record the license agreement.","False","Per MPEP 313, license agreements and documents conveying security interests can be recorded even though they do not constitute a transfer or change of title."
"A resident alien may be given limited recognition to prosecute a specific application or applications upon a showing of circumstance that it is necessary or justifiable.","True","Per 37 C.F.R. 11.9(b), a nonimmigrant alien residing in the US may be granted limited recognition if authorized by immigration authorities to represent patent applicants."
"Registered attorneys or agents who are not of record in the file may not file papers in a patent application.","False","Registered patent practitioners may file papers in patent applications even when not of record. This is considered representation that they are authorized to act on behalf of the applicant."
"Inventors may make an application jointly even if they did not work together or at the same time.","True","Per 37 C.F.R. 1.45(b), inventors may apply for a patent jointly even if they did not physically work together, did not work at the same time, did not make the same type or amount of contribution, or did not contribute to every claim."
"Your client John Brown has an application which has been pending for six months. Because the technology is not very active you have already received a Notice of Allowance and paid the issue fee. Because the application has been pending less than one year, it can be converted into a provisional application.","False","Per 37 C.F.R. 1.53(c)(2), a nonprovisional application may be converted to provisional if done before payment of the issue fee. Since the issue fee has already been paid, conversion is no longer possible."
"You received a first Official Action from the Patent Office dated July 14, 2018 and setting a three month shortened statutory period for response. Without consulting you, your client writes a letter to the USPTO accusing the Examiner of being prejudiced against independent inventors, and canceling all of the claims. The USPTO returned the letter to your client. On September 30, 2018, you file a response to the action and a Notice of Appeal. The rejection will now be reviewed by the Board of Appeals.","False","Per 37 C.F.R. 41.31(a)(1), an applicant may appeal only when claims have been twice rejected. Here, the claims have only been rejected once, so an appeal is not yet possible."
"Wilbur is an employee of Megacorp and has signed an agreement to assign any and all inventions he might make while working for the company. Wilburs new toy invention is the subject of a patent application. Wilburs wife works for a joint venture between Megacorp and a Swedish company. She has no obligation to assign any right. After learning from Wilbur of his invention, she made an important but obvious improvement to Wilburs toy. Her improvement, if kept secret, is prior art under AIA 102 to any application filed and directed to Wilburs toy.","False","Secret activity does not qualify as prior art. The USPTO views the or otherwise available to the public clause of AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1) as indicating that secret sale or use activity does not qualify as prior art."
"A provisional rejection for double patenting and a provisional rejection under pre-AIA 102(a)(2) cannot be made in the same Office Action.","False","Both provisional double patenting rejections and provisional 102(a)(2) rejections can be made in the same Office Action. The former relates to claims and the latter to disclosure, making it possible for both rejections to coexist."
"A nonprovisional application filed with only one claim can be converted into a provisional application.","True","Per 37 C.F.R. 1.53(c)(2), a nonprovisional patent application may be converted to a provisional application and be accorded the original filing date of the previously filed application."
"An Information Disclosure Statement must include a translation of any references that anticipate any claims.","False","Per MPEP 609, for non-English documents, the applicant must supply either a concise explanation of relevance OR a written English translation. A translation is optional, not required."
"A final rejection is mailed on January 5, 2018 setting a shortened three-month period for response. On Monday, April 7, 2018 a response is filed together with a request for a one-month extension of time. The response is refused entry by an advisory action dated May 14, 2018. A Notice of Appeal is filed three days after the advisory action is received. The deadline for filing an appeal brief is two months from the date of mailing of the advisory action.","False","Per 37 C.F.R. 41.37(a), the deadline for filing an appeal brief is two months from the receipt of the Notice of Appeal, not two months from the date the advisory action is mailed."
"An application filed on June 13, 1994 is replaced by a continuation filed June 10, 1995. The continuation issued on April 14, 1997. The patent will expire on June 13, 2014.","True","For applications with priority to pre-June 8, 1995 filings, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest priority filing date. Since the parent was filed June 13, 1994, the patent expires June 13, 2014 (assuming maintenance fees are paid)."
"An IDS is timely if filed within three months from the filing of a provisional application.","False","Per 37 C.F.R. 1.51(d), you do not file an IDS in a provisional patent application. Provisional applications are not examined and do not require claims."
"An application is filed with 11 claims. Claim 1 is independent, claim 2 depends from claim 1, and claim 3 states in the preamble that it depends from claims 1 and 2. Claim 4 likewise is independent, and claim 5 depends from claim 1 or claim 4. Claim 6 depends from claim 5. Claim 7 is independent and claim 8-11 each depend from claim 7. The total number of claims for calculating fees is 12.","False","The number is 13. Claim 3 counts as only one claim because it is an improper multiple dependent claim, claim 5 counts for two claims, and claim 6 counts for two claims since it depends on 5 which counts twice. All other claims count once."
"A CIP of a design application can be filed under either Rule 1.53(b) or 1.53(d).","False","Since no new matter may be introduced in a CPA (Continued Prosecution Application) under 37 CFR 1.53(d), this procedure is not available for filing a continuation-in-part application. All CIPs must be filed under 37 CFR 1.53(b)."
"Your client has invented a device for detecting bombs on aircrafts. A U.S. application directed to this invention can be advanced out of turn without payment of a fee because it will combat terrorism.","True","Per 37 C.F.R. 1.102(c), a petition to make an application special may be filed without a fee if the invention will contribute to countering terrorism, though Accelerated Examination requirements still apply."
"A utility application replacing a provisional application can be filed on the last day of pendency of the provisional by Express Mail on Saturday, Sunday, or a holiday, or it can be filed by Express Mail the next day the PTO is open for business.","True","A provisional application remains pending to the next succeeding business day if the 12-month date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday within the District of Columbia."
"If an EFS submission is successfully received (even on a Saturday, Sunday or Federal holiday within the District of Columbia), the USPTO will assign that receipt date to the submission.","True","For applications submitted through EFS-Web, the USPTO assigns the receipt date even if submitted on weekends or holidays. The date is based on Eastern Standard Time when the USPTO received the submission."
"If the application does not contain anything that can be construed as a written description, the Patent Office will mail a Notice of Incomplete Application indicating that the application lacks the specification required by 35 U.S.C. 112, but a filing date will be granted if the applicant responds timely.","False","While the USPTO will mail a Notice of Incomplete Application, no filing date will be granted if there is no written description that can be construed as a specification."
"The applicant may file a Request for Continued Examination (RCE) at any point during the pendency of the application by filing an appropriate submission and the required fee.","False","Per 37 C.F.R. 114(a), prosecution must be closed before an RCE can be filed. This occurs when the application is under appeal, after a final action, notice of allowance, or other action that closes prosecution."
"Upon request of the applicant in a newly filed utility or plant patent application, the USPTO may grant a deferral of examination for a period not extending beyond three years from the earliest filing date for which a benefit is claimed.","True","Per 37 C.F.R. 1.103(d), the Office may grant deferral of examination for up to three years from the earliest priority date. The request must include the publication fee."
"A submission as used in 37 C.F.R. 1.114 includes, but is not limited to, an information disclosure statement, an amendment to the written description, claims, or drawings, new arguments, or new evidence in support of patentability.","True","Per 37 CFR 1.114(c), a submission includes IDS, amendments to specification/claims/drawings, new arguments, or new evidence supporting patentability."
"Becoming a patent attorney is worth the incredible stress, work and anxiety of this Exam.","True",""
"A timely reply brief can be filed in every appeal following the Examiners Answer.","True","Per 37 C.F.R. 41.41, an appellant may file a single reply brief to an examiners answer within the later of two months from the date of either the examiners answer or a decision refusing to grant a petition to designate a new ground of rejection."
"A request for supplemental examination of a patent must be filed by the owner or owners of the entire right, title, and interest in the patent.","True","Per 37 C.F.R. 1.601(a), only the patent owner with complete ownership interest may file for supplemental examination. Third parties are prohibited from filing papers or participating in any manner."
"The Examiner telephoned you today and asked that you make an election between two inventions. You advised the Examiner that you did not wish to make such an election and asked for a written requirement. The Examiner will now hold the application as abandoned.","False","Per MPEP 812.01, if the patent attorney objects to making an oral election or fails to respond, a restriction letter will be mailed. The case will not be deemed abandoned."
"The following are bases for filing a reissue 1) the claims are too narrow or too broad, 2) the disclosure contains inaccuracies, 3) the applicant failed to or incorrectly claimed foreign priority, and 4) the application failed to make reference to or incorrectly made reference to prior co-pending applications.","True","Per MPEP 1402, these are the most common bases for filing a reissue application, which is done to correct an error of one kind or another."
"Canceled matter in U.S. patent files is not prior art as of the filing date of the application under 102(a)(2).","True","Canceled matter in the application file of a U.S. patent or publication is not a proper reference as of the filing date. However, such matter may be used as prior art as of the patent or publication date."
"Acts proving inventorship within Canada can be used to establish an ex parte pre-AIA 102(g) rejection of a pending application provided those acts took place after December 8, 1993.","False","Acts in foreign countries can never be the basis of a pre-AIA 102(g) rejection except during an interference."
"Claims in a reissue application can be rejected only on the basis of prior patents and publications.","False","Per 37 CFR 1.176, a reissue application is examined in the same manner as a non-reissue application. Claims are subject to any and all rejections the examiner deems appropriate, not just those based on prior patents and publications."
"After having received the international search report, the applicant has the opportunity to amend the claims of the international application by filing amendments with the International Bureau.","True","Per PCT Article 19 and MPEP 1853, after issuance of the Search Report, the applicant has one opportunity to amend claims by filing directly with the International Bureau, usually within 2 months of the Search Report mailing date."
"You receive a Notice of Allowance on May 14, 2018. The issue fee is paid on Monday, August 16, 2018 together with a request for a one-month extension of time and the proper fee. The first day that the application is abandoned is May 15, 2018.","False","An issue fee payment period cannot be extended. However, since August 14, 2018 was a Saturday (as implied by August 16 being Monday), the payment was timely as requirements falling on weekends can be completed the next business day."
"An application abandoned more than five years cannot be revived.","False","Per 37 C.F.R. 1.137, there is no time limit on reviving an abandoned application."
"An Examiners Answer cannot contain a new ground of rejection.","False","Per 37 CFR 41.39, an examiners answer may include a new ground of rejection. Any rejection using evidence not relied upon in the Office action from which the appeal is taken must be designated as a new ground of rejection."
"The Patent Office will accept color photographs in a utility application only after the granting of a petition and payment of a fee.","True","Per Rule 1.84, the Office will accept color drawings in utility patent applications only after granting a petition explaining why color drawings are necessary, along with the required fee, three sets of color drawings, and specification amendment."
"While information in the specification, claims, drawings, and any preliminary amendment specifically incorporated into an executed oath or declaration will not be expunged, a petition may be filed and a fee paid requesting expunging other material and returning it to the applicant.","True","Per Rule 1.59, information forming part of the original disclosure will not be expunged, but an applicant may request that the Office expunge other information by filing a petition."
"A patent expired for unintentional failure to pay the maintenance cannot be revived after three years.","False","The Patent Law Treaties Implementation Act (PLTIA) has eliminated any time period for properly filing a petition to accept an unintentionally delayed maintenance fee payment."
"A continuation or division filed under Rule 1.53(b) can be filed with a copy of the original oath or declaration.","True","Per Rule 1.53(b), since neither continuation nor divisional applications contain new matter, a copy of the original oath or declaration will suffice."
"A request for supplemental examination of a patent may only be filed until the patent has expired.","False","Per 37 C.F.R. 1.601(c), a request for supplemental examination may be filed at any time during the period of enforceability of the patent."
"An exclusive licensee may file papers or otherwise participate in a supplemental examination proceeding.","False","Per 37 C.F.R. 1.601(b), any party other than the patent owner is prohibited from filing papers or participating in any manner in a supplemental examination proceeding."
"Interviews are permitted in a supplemental examination proceeding.","False","Per 37 C.F.R. 1.620(e), interviews are prohibited in a supplemental examination proceeding."
"Amendments may not be filed in a supplemental examination proceeding.","True","Per 37 C.F.R. 1.620(f), no amendment may be filed in a supplemental examination proceeding."
"The request for supplemental examination must include an explanation of why each item of information submitted raises a substantial new question of patentability.","False","Per 37 C.F.R. 1.610(c), this is not a required item. The request may, but need not, include an explanation of why each item of information does or does not raise a substantial new question of patentability."
"For a non-provisional application filed on or after March 16, 2013, that claims priority to a foreign application, the applicant is not required to provide any transition application statement if the non-provisional application claims only subject matter disclosed in a foreign application filed prior to March 16, 2013.","True","A transition statement is only required when a nonprovisional application filed on or after March 16, 2013, claims benefit/priority to an application filed before March 16, 2013, AND contains a claimed invention with an effective filing date on or after March 16, 2013."
"The changes to 35 U.S.C. 102 and 103 in the AIA apply to any application that enters the national stage under 35 U.S.C. 371 on or after March 16, 2013.","False","The changes to 35 U.S.C. 102 and 103 in the AIA do not apply to any application filed before March 16, 2013. Entry into the national stage under 35 U.S.C. 371 is not considered to be the filing of a new application."
"The provisions of AIA 35 U.S.C. 102 and AIA 35 U.S.C. 103, including the one-year grace period in AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(1)(A) for inventor disclosures, are inapplicable to plant applications and patents.","False","35 U.S.C. 161 provides that provisions relating to patents for inventions apply to patents for plants, except as otherwise provided. The AIA does not provide exceptions for plant applications and patents regarding AIA 35 U.S.C. 102 and 103."
"Competent representation requires appropriate legal, scientific, and technical knowledge, as well as the skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably required.","True","Per 37 C.F.R. § 11.101, a practitioner shall provide competent representation which requires the legal, scientific, and technical knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation."
"When applying the AIA to an application, a prior art disclosure can be disqualified or antedated by showing that the inventor invented the claimed invention prior to the effective date of the prior art disclosure of the subject matter.","False","The date of invention is not relevant under AIA 35 U.S.C. 102. A prior art disclosure cannot be disqualified or antedated by showing the inventor invented the claimed invention prior to the effective date of the prior art disclosure (e.g., under 37 CFR 1.131)."
"A practitioner may not assist a client in carrying out conduct that the practitioner knows is criminal or fraudulent, but a practitioner can discuss the legal consequences of any proposed course of conduct with a client.","True","Per 37 C.F.R. 11.102(d), a practitioner cannot counsel a client to engage in criminal or fraudulent conduct, but may discuss legal consequences of any proposed course of conduct and assist in good-faith efforts to determine validity, scope, meaning or application of the law."
"The term disclosure is a generic expression intended to encompass the documents and activities enumerated in AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a).","True","The USPTO treats the term disclosure as a generic expression encompassing the documents and activities in AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a) (being patented, described in publications, in public use, on sale, or otherwise available to the public, or described in US patent applications)."
"AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a) was drafted to codify precedent under pre-AIA case law that held that private offers for sale, or private uses or secret processes practiced in the United States may be deemed patent-defeating prior art.","False","AIA 102(a) was drafted to do away with precedent that private offers for sale, private uses, or secret processes that result in a public product may be deemed prior art. The AIA imposes an overarching requirement for availability to the public."
"Under the AIA, WIPO publications of PCT applications that designate the United States are treated as U.S. patent application publications for prior art purposes, regardless of the international filing date, whether they are published in English, or whether the PCT international application enters the national stage in the United States.","True","Under 35 U.S.C. 374, a WIPO publication of a PCT application designating the US is deemed published under 35 U.S.C. 122(b) for purposes of AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2), regardless of filing date, language, or national stage entry."
"Linus Lucy files a patent application in the United States on December 14, 2013, on which he is listed as the sole inventor. Lucy and co-inventor Chuck Brown previously filed a PCT application that designated the United States, which was published December 1, 2013. The patent examiner will not be able to use the Lucy/Brown PCT application as prior art against the Lucy application in the United States because Lucy is listed as an inventor on both applications.","False","The PCT application names a different inventive entity (Lucy and Brown) than the US application (Lucy alone). In joint inventorship, only one inventor needs to be different for the inventive entities to be different. The Lucy/Brown PCT application will be prior art under AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)."
"The AIA changes the burden between the patent examiner and the applicant. Previously, an applicant was entitled to a patent unless the examiner could fashion a suitable rejection. Now, the applicant bears the burden of persuading the examiner in the first instance that a patent should be granted.","False","The introductory phrase A person shall be entitled to a patent unless remains unchanged from pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102. The USPTO still bears the initial burden (prima facie case) of explaining why requirements have not been met if a claim is rejected."
"The AIA adopts a global view of prior art disclosures and thus does not require that a public use or sale activity be in this country to be a prior art activity.","True","The AIA eliminates the requirement that prior public use or sale activity be in this country to qualify as prior art. Under AIA, public use or sale activity can be prior art regardless of where it occurs."
"Under pre-AIA law, the effective filing date of a claimed invention is determined on a claim-by-claim basis and not an application-by-application basis. The principle that different claims in the same application may be entitled to different effective filing dates with respect to the prior art remains unchanged by the AIA.","True","Claims can have different priority dates under both pre-AIA and AIA law. Different claims in the same application may be entitled to different effective filing dates with respect to the prior art."
"The determination of whether pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102 and 103 or AIA 35 U.S.C. 102 and 103 apply is made on a claim-by-claim basis.","False","The determination is made on an application basis, not claim-by-claim. If an application contains at least one claim with an effective filing date on or after March 16, 2013, the entire application is examined under AIA, even if some claims have earlier effective filing dates."
"The effective filing date for a claimed invention in a reissued patent or application for a reissue patent is determined by deeming the claim to the claimed invention to have been contained in the patent for which reissue was sought.","True","Per 35 U.S.C. 100(i)(2), the effective filing date for a claimed invention in a reissue application or reissued patent is determined by deeming the claim to have been contained in the patent for which reissue was sought."
"Under the AIA there still remains a public use exception to public use under AIA 102(a).","False","The USPTO has not taken a position on whether the AIA eliminates or preserves a public use exception under AIA 102(a), stating the issue rarely arises during prosecution and will wait for courts to resolve the matter."
"Under the AIA, contract law principles apply in order to determine whether a commercial sale or offer for sale has occurred.","True","This statement is true regardless of whether pre-AIA or AIA law applies. The USPTO treats on sale in AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1) as having the same meaning as in pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b), except the sale must make the invention available to the public."
"Under the AIA, on sale activity will bar patentability if the claimed invention was: (1) The subject of a commercial sale or offer for sale, not primarily for experimental purposes; and (2) ready for patenting.","True","The USPTO applies the same on sale standards under AIA as under pre-AIA case law: the claimed invention must be (1) subject of a commercial sale/offer not primarily for experimental purposes and (2) ready for patenting, except the sale must make the invention available to the public."
"Admissions by the applicant are no longer prior art under the AIA.","False","The USPTO continues to treat admissions by the applicant as prior art under the AIA. A statement identifying another's work as prior art is an admission for both anticipation and obviousness determinations, regardless of whether it would otherwise qualify under AIA 35 U.S.C. 102."
"Larry, Moe and Curly are listed as authors on an article published on December 1, 2013. Larry and Moe file a patent application on December 14, 2013. The patent examiner will not treat the publication as prior art because it would be apparent that the disclosure is a grace period inventor disclosure.","False","When an application names fewer inventors than a publication (application: Larry and Moe; publication: Larry, Moe, and Curly), it's not readily apparent the publication is by the inventors only. The publication would be treated as prior art under AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1) because at least Curly's contribution would be considered prior art."
"A patent application can be inspected by anyone if they know the filing date.","False","Patent applications are generally confidential unless they have been published or permission is granted by the attorney of record (MPEP 104)."
"A joint inventor named in a patent application automatically has the right to inspect the application.","True","Named inventors have access to their applications unless assigned away, per MPEP 104."
"A company that employs the inventors may automatically grant permission to a third party to inspect the application.","False","Only an assignee of record or the attorney of record can grant permission to inspect (37 CFR § 1.14(a))."
"A third party who claims they should be named as an inventor may inspect an application if they obtain permission from the filing attorney.","True","The attorney of record has the power to grant access to the application (MPEP 104)."
"An applicant may authorize an agent to access an unpublished patent application.","True","An applicant may provide written permission for an agent or attorney to inspect an unpublished patent application."
"All pending utility patent applications are open to the public.","False","Utility patent applications remain confidential unless published (37 CFR § 1.11, MPEP 101)."
"All reissue applications are open to the public.","True","Reissue applications are public (MPEP 101)."

"All pending design and plant patent applications are open to the public.","False","These applications remain confidential unless published."
"The public has access to an abandoned non-published patent application.","False","Abandoned applications are confidential unless referenced in a public document."
"A terminated interference proceeding involving an issued patent and a pending patent application is open to the public.","True","Once an interference is terminated, the records become publicly available (MPEP 122, 37 CFR § 1.11(e))."
"A continuation-in-part application of an issued patent is automatically open to the public.","False","It remains confidential unless published."
"All abandoned patent applications are open to the public.","False","Abandoned applications remain confidential unless relied upon in another public document."
"All pending patent applications are open to the public.","False","Pending applications remain confidential unless published or referenced in a public document."
"All assignment records relating to pending patent applications are open to the public.","True","Assignment records for pending applications are public (37 CFR § 1.12)."
"A patent practitioner may file a petition requesting withdrawal of an examiner's objection to a specification and suspend further action on the claims until the petition is decided.","False","Per MPEP 706.01, the appropriate response is to file a request for reconsideration, distinctly pointing out errors and responding to the rejection and objection."
"A request for reconsideration should include distinct and specific arguments addressing errors in an examiner's requirement while also responding to the rejection and objection.","True","Per MPEP 706.01, filing a request for reconsideration is the proper response when disputing an examiner’s rejection, objection, and requirement."
"A practitioner may appeal the examiner’s objection to the specification directly to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences.","False","Per 37 CFR § 1.111(b), objections to the specification must first be challenged via a petition, not an appeal."
"An examiner’s requirement for a substitute specification can be challenged through reconsideration rather than immediate compliance.","True","Per MPEP 706.01, an applicant may request reconsideration before complying with the requirement."
"A claim reading 'An alloy consisting of 70.5 to 77.5% iron, 15.0 to 17.0% cobalt, 0.5 to 1.0% carbon, up to 2.5% chromium, and at least 7.0% tungsten' is anticipated by a reference disclosing an alloy with 76.0% iron, up to 15.0% cobalt, 0.5% carbon, and 8.5% tungsten.","True","Per MPEP 2131, 'up to 2.5% chromium' includes 0%, meaning the reference discloses all elements of the claim within the claimed range."
"A claim that includes the phrase 'consisting of' excludes the possibility of additional unlisted elements in the composition.","True","The phrase 'consisting of' is a closed transition phrase that excludes unlisted components per MPEP 2111.03."
"Obviousness under 35 USC § 103 requires at least one prior art reference under 35 USC § 102.","True","A proper obviousness rejection must be based on prior art references under 35 USC § 102, per MPEP 706.02."
"A prima facie case of obviousness must include a reasonable expectation of success based on the applicant’s own disclosure.","False","Expectation of success cannot be based on the applicant's disclosure. It must be supported by prior art, per Graham v. Deere, 383 U.S. 1 (1966) and MPEP 706.02."
"In determining obviousness, a reference must contain a teaching or suggestion of every claimed limitation.","True","Per MPEP 706.02, an examiner must show a teaching, suggestion, or motivation for every limitation in the claim."
"A U.S. patent that issued after a patent application’s filing date can never be considered prior art under 35 USC § 102 or § 103.","False","Under 35 USC 102(a)(2), a later-issued patent can still be prior art if it was effectively filed before the applicant’s filing date."
"If a prior art reference is published more than one year before an application’s filing date, it cannot be overcome by an antedating affidavit.","True","Per MPEP 706.02, an antedating affidavit cannot be used if the reference qualifies as 35 USC 102(a)(1) prior art."
"Hoppe, a Canadian patent issued on January 5, 2013, and based on a Canadian application filed on March 18, 2012, is prior art against a U.S. patent application filed on April 1, 2014.","True","Hoppe qualifies as prior art under 35 USC 102(a)(1) because it was publicly available before the U.S. application was filed."
"A rejected patent claim may be defended by arguing that the prior art references, individually or in combination, fail to teach the claimed invention.","True","Per MPEP 706.02, an applicant may argue against the examiner’s reasoning in combining references."
"Goodman, a U.S. patent that issued on September 20, 2014, from an application filed on February 5, 2012, cannot be prior art under 35 USC 102(a)(2).","False","A U.S. patent is prior art as of its effective filing date under 35 USC 102(a)(2), making Goodman prior art."
"Obviousness rejections require that there be some suggestion, motivation, or teaching to combine prior art references.","True","Per MPEP 2141, obviousness requires motivation to combine prior art references, as established in KSR v. Teleflex."
"An examiner’s rejection of a claim under 35 USC § 103 can be overcome by merely proving that the primary reference does not teach the claimed invention.","False","Per MPEP 2143, an obviousness rejection stands if the combination of references as a whole renders the claim obvious."
"A terminated interference proceeding involving an issued patent and a pending patent application is open to the public.","True","Per 37 CFR § 1.11(e), terminated interference proceedings involving issued patents are publicly available."
"A continuation-in-part application of an issued patent is automatically open to the public.","False","Per 37 CFR § 1.14, a continuation-in-part remains confidential unless published."

"An applicant may submit new evidence of commercial success to the Board at any time during an appeal.","False","Per 37 CFR §§ 41.33(b) and 41.33(d), new evidence such as declarations cannot be submitted once an appeal is forwarded to the Board."
"If an applicant wants the Board to consider new evidence of commercial success, they must file a request to remand the case to the examiner.","True","Per 37 CFR § 41.35(e), a request to remand must show good cause for why the evidence was not submitted earlier."
"A Notice of Allowance is mailed on April 4, 2019. The issue fee is timely if paid within three months and one day from the Notice of Allowance.","False","Per 35 USC § 151 and MPEP 1306, the issue fee is due within three months, not three months and one day."
"An issue fee can be paid after six months from the Notice of Allowance with a petition and late payment fee.","True","Per 37 CFR § 1.8, the USPTO may accept late issue fee payments with a petition and extension request."
"If an issue fee is mailed three months and three days after the Notice of Allowance, but includes a certificate of mailing dated July 5, 2019, it is considered timely.","True","Per MPEP 505, the certificate of mailing date determines timeliness under 37 CFR § 1.8."
"An originally filed patent specification states that a composition contains 'up to 6% surfactant.' During prosecution, the applicant amends the specification and claims to state 'up to 60% surfactant.' Would this amendment be considered new matter?","True","Per MPEP 608.04 and 706.03(o), increasing a numerical value beyond the originally disclosed limit introduces new matter because it adds information not present in the application as filed."
"A patent application originally discloses a composition containing 'up to 6% surfactant.' If the claims include a dependent claim specifying '3 to 6% surfactant,' can the applicant amend the specification to reflect this range without introducing new matter?","True","Per MPEP 608.04, amending the specification to include a range that was already disclosed in the originally filed claims does not introduce new matter, since the claims form part of the original disclosure."
"An applicant originally discloses a chemical composition with 'up to 10% stabilizer.' If they later amend the claims to specify '5 to 15% stabilizer,' would this be considered new matter?","True","Per MPEP 608.04 and 2163.05(III), extending the upper bound beyond the original disclosure (10% → 15%) adds information not present at filing and is considered new matter, as values between 10% and 15% were not previously disclosed."
"If an originally filed patent application states that a function may be performed by 'any known circuits,' and the applicant later provides a list of commercially available circuits in an amendment, does this constitute new matter?","False","Per MPEP 608.04, providing specific examples of what was generically disclosed does not constitute new matter if those examples were known and available as of the filing date. The amendment merely identifies examples within the scope of 'any known circuits.'"
"If a specification discloses specific values of 5%, 10%, and 20% for a component, would amending the claims to recite a range of '5% to 20%' constitute new matter?","False","Per MPEP 2163.05(III), a claimed range that encompasses disclosed specific examples is supported by the original disclosure, even if the exact range was not explicitly disclosed, provided the new range does not introduce any previously undisclosed critical values."
"If an applicant discovers that a previously disclosed composition inherently possesses an undisclosed property, would amending the specification to include this property constitute new matter?","False","Per MPEP 2163.07(a), inherent properties of disclosed subject matter are not considered new matter if the inherency can be scientifically proven. The newly discovered property was necessarily present in the originally disclosed composition."
"An originally filed specification describes a medical device as 'flexible.' If the applicant later amends the specification to state that the device has 'a flexibility of 2-5 N/mm,' is this considered new matter?","True","Per MPEP 2163.05(II), adding specific numerical values to quantify a general property constitutes new matter when those specific values were not originally disclosed, as the quantitative range introduces previously undisclosed limitations."
"If an originally filed application contains experimental data for Examples 1, 2, and 3, can the applicant add Examples 4 and 5 showing additional embodiments within the scope of the claims without introducing new matter?","True","Per MPEP 608.04 and 2163, adding new examples constitutes new matter even if they fall within the scope of the original claims, as specific embodiments not originally disclosed represent information not present at the time of filing."
"An originally filed specification discloses a process with a reaction temperature of '50°C to 100°C.' If the applicant later amends the claims to specify a preferred range of '60°C to 90°C,' would this be considered new matter?","False","Per MPEP 2163.05(III), a narrower range within a broader disclosed range does not constitute new matter as the narrower range does not introduce any values that were not already disclosed in the original application."
"An application originally describes a device having 'a plurality of holes.' If the applicant later amends the specification to state 'between 3 and 20 holes,' does this introduce new matter?","True","Per MPEP 608.04 and 2163.05(III), adding specific numerical limits to a general term like 'plurality' constitutes new matter, as the specific range '3 to 20' introduces previously undisclosed boundaries and potential criticality."
"Adding a statement that an application is a 'continuation-in-part' when no reference to a parent application was originally made is not considered new matter.","False","Per MPEP 608.01(p), introducing a new continuity claim (such as a CIP reference) constitutes new matter."
"Amending a specification to incorporate by reference another pending application that was not previously mentioned does not constitute new matter.","False","Per MPEP 608.04(a), retroactively incorporating an outside reference into a specification introduces new matter."
"If an originally filed specification broadly states that a function may be performed by 'any of a large number of known circuits,' providing a list of publications referencing such circuits does not constitute new matter.","True","Per MPEP 608.04, referencing known prior art circuits without adding new details does not introduce new matter."
"A process of purifying a naturally occurring element can constitute patentable subject matter.","True","Per MPEP 2106 and 35 USC § 101, a process that transforms a natural element into a new, useful form may be patentable."
"A method utilizing a new scientific principle is always patentable.","False","Per MPEP 2106 and 35 USC § 101, a scientific principle alone is not patentable unless it is applied in a specific, useful process."
"A method of printing a business form is not patentable subject matter under 35 USC § 101.","False","Per MPEP 2106, a method of printing may be patentable if it involves a novel and non-obvious technical process."
"A process that is useful solely for the production of atomic energy can be patentable subject matter.","True","Per 35 USC § 101 and MPEP 150, processes related to atomic energy production can be patentable unless restricted by specific laws."
"If a composition has been used as a lubricant for over 20 years, a patent application claiming its use as a mouse bait is not patentable.","False","Per MPEP 706.03(a), a new, non-obvious use of a known composition can be patentable."
"A U.S. patent application may be filed for a method of using a known composition in an unexpected new way, even if the composition itself is not new.","True","Per 35 USC § 100(b) and MPEP 706.03(a), novel and non-obvious methods of use can be patentable."
"A well-known composition cannot be patented, even if its intended use is new and inventive.","False","Per MPEP 2112 and 35 USC § 100(b), a known composition itself is not patentable, but a novel and non-obvious use of it may be."
"Filing a patent application for a conventional mouse trap that has been publicly known for decades is likely to result in a rejection for lack of novelty.","True","Per 35 USC § 102 and MPEP 706, an invention must be new to be patentable."
"An applicant may file an amendment after a final rejection to comply with a formal requirement set by the examiner without triggering 37 CFR § 1.116(b).","True","Per MPEP 1207, amendments that comply with formal requirements, such as responding to an examiner’s suggested changes, do not trigger 37 CFR § 1.116(b)."
"An amendment filed after a final rejection that adds additional claims without canceling an equal number of rejected claims is automatically entered.","False","Per MPEP 1207, amendments that add claims without canceling a corresponding number of rejected claims are not entered after a final rejection."
"An amendment converting claims from an article of manufacture to process claims after a final rejection is automatically entered.","False","Per MPEP 1207, amendments introducing new claim types (e.g., process claims replacing article claims) may require a new search and introduce new issues, preventing automatic entry."
"An applicant who amends all independent claims after a final rejection must show good and sufficient reasons why the amendments are necessary and were not earlier presented.","True","Per 37 CFR § 1.116(b), amendments after final rejection must be justified with sufficient reasoning explaining why they were not earlier presented."
"After receiving an Advisory Action rejecting a proposed amendment to a final rejection, an applicant can prevent abandonment by filing a notice of appeal and requesting an extension of time with the appropriate fees.","True","Per 37 CFR § 1.136(a) and MPEP 706.07(f), filing a notice of appeal with an extension request prevents abandonment."
"A petition to waive the six-month statutory response period for a final rejection is an effective strategy to prevent abandonment.","False","Per 37 CFR § 1.136, statutory response periods cannot be waived; an applicant must act within the six-month period or file an appeal."
"An amendment after a final rejection is automatically entered if it cancels claims, adopts suggestions made by the examiner, or removes issues for appeal.","True","Per 37 CFR § 1.116 and MPEP 714.13, amendments that cancel claims or adopt examiner suggestions may be entered after a final rejection."
"An amendment filed after a final rejection and touching on the merits of the application is always entered if new prior art is cited.","False","Per 37 CFR § 1.116(b), amendments touching on the merits are not automatically entered, even if they cite new prior art."
"A Notice of Appeal must always accompany an amendment filed after a final rejection.","False","Per MPEP 1207, an amendment after final rejection can be entered without a Notice of Appeal if it complies with formal requirements or removes issues for appeal."
"An amendment filed in response to a final rejection is entered as a matter of right if it cancels some, but not all, of the rejected claims.","True","Per MPEP 714.13, canceling some rejected claims does not require examiner approval and can be entered as a matter of right."
"A final rejection mailed on October 19, 2018, with a three-month shortened statutory response period, means the last possible date to file a Notice of Appeal with a two-month extension request is April 19, 2019.","True","Per MPEP 710.02(e), the two-month extension of time begins from the Advisory Action date, but cannot exceed the six-month statutory deadline."
"An amendment filed after a final rejection that includes a new claim while canceling a previously pending claim so that the total number of claims remains the same must be entered.","False","Per MPEP 714.13, adding new claims after a final rejection is not automatically permitted even if the total number of claims remains unchanged."
"The deadline to pay the basic national fee for a PCT application entering the U.S. national stage is 30 months from the priority date.","True","Per 37 CFR § 1.495(b)(1) and MPEP 1893.01(a), the basic national fee must be paid within 30 months from the earliest claimed priority date to avoid abandonment."
"A Demand for International Preliminary Examination must be filed with the Receiving Office.","False","Per PCT Article 31(6)(a) and MPEP 1864, a Demand for International Preliminary Examination must be filed directly with the competent International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA), not the Receiving Office."
"To enter the U.S. national stage of a PCT application, an applicant must file a copy of the international application, a translation if not in English, and pay the basic national fee.","True","Per 37 CFR § 1.495(b) and MPEP 1893.01(a), these elements constitute the minimum requirements for national stage entry under 35 USC § 371."
"For a PCT application that names the U.S., the effective prior art date under pre-AIA 35 USC 102(e) is the date the patent is granted.","False","Per pre-AIA 35 USC 102(e) and MPEP 2127, the effective prior art date is the international filing date, provided the application was published in English and designated the U.S."
"For a PCT application designating the U.S. and claiming priority to a foreign application, the deadline for U.S. national phase entry can be extended beyond 30 months from the priority date by paying an extension of time fee.","False","Per 37 CFR § 1.495(b) and MPEP 1893.01(a), the 30-month deadline for national phase entry cannot be extended by paying an extension fee; failure to meet this deadline results in abandonment."
"An international application filed under the PCT must include the name of the inventor to obtain an international filing date.","False","Per PCT Article 11(1) and MPEP 1810, the minimum requirements for an international filing date include the applicant's name but not necessarily the inventor's name."
"A U.S. patent application can serve as a priority document for a PCT application if the PCT application is filed within 12 months of the U.S. filing date.","True","Per PCT Article 8, Paris Convention Article 4, and MPEP 1828, a U.S. patent application can serve as a priority document if the PCT is filed within 12 months."
