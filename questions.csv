This represents a significant change from pre-AIA law, as foreign filing dates can now be used as prior art dates against U.S. applications if they serve as the effective filing date of a published PCT that designated the U.S.",1800 - Patent Cooperation Treaty
"Under the AIA, a PCT application must be published in English to be considered prior art as of its publication date.","False","Per AIA 35 USC § 102(a)(1) and MPEP § 2154.01(a), a published PCT application is prior art as of its publication date regardless of the language of publication. The AIA eliminated the pre-AIA requirement that PCT applications must be published in English to be effective prior art. Any published PCT application is now 'available to the public' under § 102(a)(1) as of its publication date in any language.",1800 - Patent Cooperation Treaty
"Filing fees for a PCT application must be paid at the time of filing to secure an international filing date.","False","Per PCT Article 11 and MPEP § 1810, payment of fees is not required to secure an international filing date. The required elements are: an indication the application is intended as international, designation of at least one contracting state, identification of the applicant, a description, and at least one claim. Fees can be paid later, typically within one month of filing, though late fees may apply.",1800 - Patent Cooperation Treaty
"Unity of invention in PCT applications is a more restrictive standard than the U.S. independent and distinct invention standard for restriction.","False","Per PCT Rule 13 and MPEP § 1850, unity of invention in PCT applications is generally considered less restrictive than the U.S. 'independent and distinct' standard. Unity of invention requires a 'special technical relationship' among claims involving shared 'special technical features.' This standard often allows more diverse claims to remain together than would be permitted under U.S. restriction practice, resulting in fewer required divisional applications.",1800 - Patent Cooperation Treaty
"Under the AIA, a published PCT application that does not designate the U.S. cannot be used as prior art under § 102(a)(2) against a U.S. application.","True","Per AIA 35 USC § 102(a)(2) and MPEP § 2154.01(a), only published applications that designate the U.S. can serve as prior art under § 102(a)(2). A PCT application that does not designate the U.S. cannot qualify under this provision. However, it's important to note that such a PCT application could still qualify as prior art under § 102(a)(1) as of its publication date, regardless of designation status.",1800 - Patent Cooperation Treaty
"A protest against a pending patent application can be filed by a member of the public even if the application has not yet been published.","True","Per 37 CFR § 1.291(a) and MPEP § 1901.01, a member of the public may file a protest in a pending application, even if unpublished, provided the protestor can either: (1) identify the application by application number, or (2) serve the protest under 37 CFR § 1.248 in an application that cannot be identified by application number.",1900 - Protest
"A protest against a pending patent application may include evidence of prior public use or sale in the United States.","True","Per MPEP § 1901.02, a protest may include any information that would be relevant to patentability, including evidence of prior public use or sale under 35 USC § 102. The evidence is not limited to prior patents and printed publications.",1900 - Protest
"When filing a protest, the protestor should submit only initial evidence and may supplement with additional evidence in subsequent submissions.","False","Per 37 CFR § 1.291(c) and MPEP § 1901.02, a protest must be complete at the time of submission; protestors should submit all evidence relied upon in the initial protest, as subsequent submissions will not be entered unless requested by the examiner.",1900 - Protest
"A protestor is entitled to receive copies of Office actions issued after the protest has been filed.","False","Per 37 CFR § 1.291(c) and MPEP § 1901.05, protestors do not have access to the application file and do not receive copies of Office actions or any other notifications regarding the status of the application after filing a protest.",1900 - Protest
"The protest program has been replaced by statutory reexamination procedures.","False","Per MPEP § 1901, the protest program remains active and distinct from ex parte reexamination (MPEP § 2209) and inter partes review procedures. These are separate mechanisms with different purposes, requirements, and timing considerations.",1900 - Protest
"Only registered patent practitioners can file protests against pending patent applications on behalf of third parties.","False","Per 37 CFR § 1.291 and MPEP § 1901.01, any member of the public may file a protest; there is no requirement that the protest be filed by a registered patent practitioner, and individuals may file protests pro se.",1900 - Protest
"A protest must include the name and address of the protestor to be considered by the Office.","True","Per 37 CFR § 1.291(b) and MPEP § 1901.03, a protest must include the name and correspondence address of the protestor to be considered; anonymous protests will not be entered into the application file or considered.",1900 - Protest
"If a protest is properly filed in an application that is subsequently abandoned, the protest will still be considered if the application is revived.","True","Per MPEP § 1901.01, a properly filed protest will be considered by the examiner when the application is taken up for examination, including after revival of an abandoned application, provided the protest was timely filed.",1900 - Protest
"A protest can be filed at any time during the pendency of an application, including after a notice of allowance has been issued.","False","Per 37 CFR § 1.291(b) and MPEP § 1901.04, a protest must be submitted prior to the date the application was published or the mailing of a notice of allowance, whichever occurs first, unless the protestor had prior knowledge of the application.",1900 - Protest
"If a protestor can prove they had prior knowledge of an unpublished application, they can file a protest after the application is published.","True","Per 37 CFR § 1.291(b) and MPEP § 1901.04, a protest may be submitted after publication if the protestor can prove that they had prior knowledge of the application and that the protest is being submitted prior to the notice of allowance.",1900 - Protest
"When filing a protest, the protestor may request an oral hearing to present arguments about the evidence submitted.","False","Per MPEP § 1901, the protest procedure does not provide for an oral hearing by the protestor; it is a paper submission only, and the protestor has no right to participate in the examination process.",1900 - Protest
"A protest must include a statement that a copy of the protest has been served upon the applicant or their attorney.","True","Per 37 CFR § 1.291(a) and MPEP § 1901.03, when a protestor can identify the application by number, a statement that a copy of the protest has been served upon the applicant or their attorney is required, along with the manner of service.",1900 - Protest
"A claim in the application as filed is indefinite which initially refers to 'a screw' when the only basis for 'a screw' is shown in the original application drawings, and the scope of the claim is ascertainable by one skilled in the art.","False","Per MPEP § 2173.05(o), a claim is not indefinite merely because it refers to elements shown only in the drawings. If one skilled in the art can ascertain the scope of the claim based on the drawings and specification, the claim satisfies the definiteness requirement of 35 USC § 112(b).",2100 - Patentability
"Where a range of '35 mg - 80 mg,' and specific examples of '40 mg' and '65 mg' are described in the original specification which was filed with a declaration under 37 CFR § 1.63, and an amendment changing the numerical range in a claim from '35 mg - 80 mg' to 'at least 42 mg' is filed after the application is filed, the amended claim is supported by the written description in the original specification.","False","Per MPEP § 2163.05(III), a range with specific endpoints and examples within the range does not support a new range with an open-ended endpoint ('at least 42 mg'). While 42 mg falls within the original range, the open-ended range would encompass values above 80 mg, which wasn't originally disclosed and thus constitutes new matter.",2100 - Patentability
"The specification and claims of a utility patent application, as filed, do not describe a scanning device as having a specific angular view which is essential or critical to the invention. The generic claims in the application are amended for non-prior art reasons to limit the scanning device to having a specific angular view, and a patent is granted with the generic claims drawn to a scanning device having a specific angular view. A reissue application removing the limitations directed to the specific angular view is properly broadened and supported when filed by the same applicant one year after the patent issued.","True","Per MPEP § 1412.03 and 35 USC § 251, a reissue application filed within two years of patent issuance can properly broaden claims by removing limitations that were not described as essential in the original specification. Since the specific angular view was not described as essential or critical in the original application, removing this limitation in a reissue application filed within the two-year statutory period is proper.",2100 - Patentability
"A claim in the application as filed is definite when it refers to not only a broad numerical range, but also to a preferred narrow range that falls within the broader range in the same claim, such as when referring to 'a pH range between 7 and 12, preferably between 9 and 10.'","False","Per MPEP § 2173.05(c), a broad range or limitation together with a narrow range or limitation that falls within the broad range or limitation in the same claim is indefinite when the resulting claim does not clearly set forth the metes and bounds of the patent protection desired. The phrase 'preferably' renders the claim indefinite because it is unclear whether the limitations following the phrase are part of the claimed invention.",2100 - Patentability
"The scope of enablement required to support claims in a patent application varies inversely to the degree of predictability involved, but even in unpredictable arts, applicant needs to disclose every operable species.","False","Per MPEP § 2164.03, while the scope of enablement does vary inversely with the degree of predictability involved, an applicant is not required to disclose every operable species. In unpredictable arts, more examples may be needed, but enablement of every species is not required if the specification provides sufficient guidance for one skilled in the art to make and use the invention without undue experimentation.",2100 - Patentability
"Where a range of '10 psi to 50 psi,' and a specific example of '42 psi' are described in the original specification which was filed with a declaration under 37 CFR § 1.63, and an amendment changing the numerical range in a claim from '10 psi to 50 psi' to 'between 35 psi and 45 psi' is filed after the application is filed, the amended claim is supported by the written description in the original specification.","True","Per MPEP § 2163.05(III), a narrower range falling completely within an originally disclosed broader range can be supported by the original disclosure, especially when the new range encompasses a specific example (42 psi) disclosed in the specification. Since 35-45 psi falls entirely within the original 10-50 psi range and includes the specific example of 42 psi, the amendment is properly supported.",2100 - Patentability
"Publications dated after the filing date of an application providing information or the current state of the art first publicly disclosed after the filing date can supplement the disclosure in the application to make the disclosure enabling where the application did not disclose how to make or use the claimed invention, and claims in the application should not be rejected under 35 USC § 112(a) for lack of an enabling disclosure.","False","Per MPEP § 2164.05(a), the specification must be enabling as of the filing date of the application. Information or knowledge that became available only after the filing date cannot be used to show that the application was enabling when filed. If the application did not disclose how to make or use the claimed invention at the time of filing, later publications cannot cure this deficiency, and the claims should be rejected under 35 USC § 112(a).",2100 - Patentability
"A claim in the application as filed is indefinite when a Markush expression is introduced by the term 'comprising,' for example, 'R is selected from the group comprising A, B, C and D.'","True","Per MPEP § 2173.05(h), a Markush grouping is a closed group of alternatives. Using the transitional phrase 'comprising' in a Markush expression is improper because it creates uncertainty as to whether the claim requires only the listed members or permits additional, unlisted members. The proper format is 'selected from the group consisting of A, B, C, and D.'",2100 - Patentability
"Claims in a reissue application amended to omit the 'in synchronism' limitation in the original patent disclosure and thereby permit the claimed invention to have scanning means and indexing means not 'in synchronism' are not supported by the original disclosure in the patent application describing the invention as having only scanning means and indexing means 'in synchronism.'","True","Per MPEP § 1412.01 and § 2163.05, a reissue application cannot claim subject matter not supported by the original disclosure. If the original disclosure described only synchronous operation as essential to the invention, amending claims to omit this limitation would introduce new matter by claiming an invention (asynchronous operation) not described in the original disclosure.",2100 - Patentability
"Publications dated after the filing date of an application may not be used by the patent examiner to support a rejection under 35 USC § 112(a) that the application does not provide an enabling disclosure which is commensurate in scope with the claimed invention.","False","Per MPEP § 2164.05(a), while post-filing date references cannot be used to show enablement exists when it did not at filing, they can be used to show the state of the art and what would have been considered undue experimentation. Later publications can be used by examiners to demonstrate that the disclosure was not enabling for the full scope claimed, particularly in unpredictable arts.",2100 - Patentability
"A claim in the application as filed is definite which initially refers to 'an aluminum lever,' and 'a plastic lever' and thereafter refers to 'said lever.'","False","Per MPEP § 2173.05(e), where a claim refers to 'said' or 'the' element, and there are multiple antecedent elements that could be referenced, the claim is indefinite. Since the claim introduces both 'an aluminum lever' and 'a plastic lever,' subsequent reference to 'said lever' is ambiguous as it's unclear which of the two levers is being referenced.",2100 - Patentability
"Only one example in the specification of an application may provide enablement commensurate with the scope of the claims in the application, and if such enablement is provided, the claims should not be rejected under 35 USC § 112(a) for lack of an enabling disclosure.","False","Per MPEP § 2164.02 and § 2164.06, while a single example can sometimes provide enabling disclosure, this is highly dependent on the predictability of the art and the breadth of the claims. In unpredictable arts or with broad claims, a single example is often insufficient to enable the full scope of the claims. The determination is case-specific, considering the Wands factors, rather than a general rule that one example is always sufficient.",2100 - Patentability
"Disclosure of a specific utility of an invention and disclosure of a credible basis supporting the specific utility do not provide a basis for concluding that the requirements of 35 USC § 112(a) have been met where one of ordinary skill in the art must engage in undue experimentation to actually practice the invention.","True","Per MPEP § 2164.01 and § 2107.01, disclosure of a specific and credible utility is necessary but not sufficient to satisfy 35 USC § 112(a). The enablement requirement is separate from the utility requirement. Even if an application discloses a specific and credible utility, if undue experimentation would be needed to practice the invention, the application fails to meet the enablement requirement of 35 USC § 112(a).",2100 - Patentability
"A claim in the application as filed is definite under 112(b) which initially refers to 'the lever,' or 'said lever,' when the claim contains no earlier recitation or limitation to a lever, and it is unclear as to what element the limitation is referencing.","False","Per MPEP § 2173.05(e), where a claim refers to 'the' or 'said' element, there must be proper antecedent basis for that element. Using 'the lever' or 'said lever' without previously introducing 'a lever' in the claim creates an antecedent basis problem, making the claim indefinite because it's unclear what lever is being referenced.",2100 - Patentability
"Claims in a U.S. patent application directed to a broad genus of painkillers with numerous variations are not supported by a foreign priority application where the foreign priority application discloses only two species of painkillers within the broad genus, and not the broad genus per se.","True","Per MPEP § 2163.05(I) and Federal Circuit precedent (e.g., In re Lukach, 442 F.2d 967), disclosure of a few species within a genus does not necessarily provide written description support for the entire genus. For complex chemical inventions like painkillers, disclosure of only two species without discussion of the genus as a whole would not typically provide adequate written description support for claims to the entire genus.",2100 - Patentability

"Market testing an invention to determine commercial viability is considered experimental use that can negate public use as a bar to patentability.","False","Per MPEP § 2133.03(e)(6) and TP Laboratories v. Professional Positioners, 224 USPQ 549, testing to determine commercial acceptance or market demand is not experimental use related to the invention's functionality. Such use is commercial in nature and cannot negate a public use bar.",2100 - Patentability
"For experimental use to negate public use as a bar to patentability, the testing must be conducted under the supervision and control of the inventor.","True","Per MPEP § 2133.03(e)(5), control by the inventor over the experiment is an important factor in establishing experimental use. Testing conducted under the inventor's supervision demonstrates that the use was for experimental purposes related to the invention rather than commercial exploitation.",2100 - Patentability
"The necessity of conducting testing in public is a factor that supports a finding of experimental use rather than public use as a bar to patentability.","True","Per MPEP § 2133.03(e)(2), if the nature of the invention requires public testing (e.g., a road surface or bridge), this supports the conclusion that the use was experimental. Courts recognize that some inventions cannot be adequately tested in private environments.",2100 - Patentability
"A claim containing the phrase 'normal process conditions, such as ambient temperature' provides clear boundaries for the scope of protection and would be considered definite.","False","Per MPEP § 2173.05(d), the phrase 'such as' renders a claim indefinite because it creates confusion about whether the specific parameter (ambient temperature) is a required limitation or merely exemplary. Additionally, 'normal process conditions' is subjective and varies across different industries.",2100 - Patentability
"If a doctoral thesis is cataloged in a library's electronic database but not physically accessible to the public, it does not qualify as a printed publication.","False","Per MPEP § 2128.01 and In re Hall, electronic accessibility can establish public availability.
