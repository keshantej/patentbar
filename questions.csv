"For a utility rejection under 35 USC § 101, the invention must be shown to be wholly and completely inoperative.",True,"Per MPEP § 2107.01(II), an invention need only have a specific, substantial, and credible utility to satisfy 35 USC § 101. A utility rejection is only appropriate when the claimed invention is totally incapable of achieving any useful result.",2100 - Patentability
"Under the USPTO’s subject matter eligibility framework, the first step is to determine whether the claim is directed to a judicial exception such as an abstract idea, law of nature, or natural phenomenon.",False,"False. The first step under the USPTO’s framework (MPEP § 2106) is to determine whether the claim is directed to a statutory category—process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter. The analysis of judicial exceptions (Step 2A) comes only after this threshold statutory check is satisfied.",2100 - Patentability
"If the applicant files all required national stage documents before the 30-month deadline but does not request early entry, the USPTO will begin treating the application as a U.S. national stage application immediately.",False,"False. Under MPEP § 1893.01(a), unless the applicant expressly requests early entry, the USPTO will wait until the 30-month deadline before treating the application as a U.S. national stage application, even if all materials were filed earlier.",1800 - Patent Cooperation Treaty
"When the Board issues a new ground of rejection in its decision, the applicant may respond by filing an amendment under 37 CFR § 1.111 to reopen prosecution before the examiner.",True,"True. Per 37 CFR § 41.50(b) and MPEP § 1214.01, when the Board issues a new ground of rejection, the applicant may respond by filing an amendment or new evidence under 37 CFR § 1.111, which reopens prosecution before the examiner. This is one of two options available—the other being a request for rehearing under 37 CFR § 41.52.",1200 - Appeal

"When the Board issues a new ground of rejection, the examiner may issue a Supplemental Examiner's Answer responding to the applicant's arguments.",False,"False. Per MPEP § 1207.05, a Supplemental Examiner’s Answer is not appropriate when the Board enters a new ground of rejection. The applicant must either reopen prosecution under 37 CFR § 1.111 or request rehearing under 37 CFR § 41.52.",1200 - Appeal
"If the applicant chooses to request rehearing after a new ground of rejection is issued by the Board, the request must specifically address the new ground.",True,"True. Per 37 CFR § 41.52(a)(1) and MPEP § 1214.03, a request for rehearing must address each point of law or fact that the applicant believes the Board misapprehended or overlooked, including any new ground of rejection.",1200 - Appeal
An applicant must respond to a new ground of rejection by the Board within two months from the date of the Board’s decision.,True,"True.

"When a reexamination request is denied because no substantial new question of patentability was raised, the requester is entitled to a refund of a significant portion of the reexamination fee.",True,"The USPTO provides a partial refund when a reexamination request is denied. Under 37 CFR 1.26(c), a portion of the reexamination fee will be refunded if the Director decides not to institute reexamination. This refund policy acknowledges that substantial USPTO resources are only expended when reexamination is actually conducted, not merely when reviewing a request that is ultimately denied.",2200 - Citation of Prior Art and Ex Parte Reexamination of Patents
"If the USPTO denies a request for ex parte reexamination finding no substantial new question of patentability, the third-party requester may appeal this decision to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board.",False,The denial of a request for ex parte reexamination is a final agency action under 37 CFR 1.515(c) that is not subject to appeal or judicial review. The requester has no standing to participate in the examination process once a request is filed and cannot appeal a denial. This differs significantly from inter partes review where requesters have participatory rights throughout the proceedings.,2200 - Citation of Prior Art and Ex Parte Reexamination of Patents
"In an ex parte reexamination proceeding, the two-month response period for replying to an Office action can be extended by filing a request for extension of time showing sufficient cause under 37 CFR 1.136(a).",False,"In an ex parte reexamination proceeding, the two-month response period for replying to an Office action cannot be extended using 37 CFR 1.136(a); instead, extensions of time must comply with the procedures set forth in 37 CFR 1.550(c), which requires a showing of “sufficient cause” and payment of a specified petition fee. The use of 37 CFR 1.136(a) for extensions of time is expressly not permitted in reexamination proceedings.",2200 - Citation of Prior Art and Ex Parte Reexamination of Patents
"Once a reexamination request has been granted, the examiner is permitted to reject claims based only on the prior art patents and publications cited in the reexamination request.",False,"While reexamination is limited to prior art in the form of patents and printed publications, 37 CFR 1.552(a) clearly states that reexamination is not limited to the patents and publications cited in the request. After reexamination is ordered, the examiner may consider any patents or printed publications, including those newly discovered by the examiner or newly cited by any party. However, rejections cannot be based on other forms of prior art such as public use or on-sale activities.",2200 - Citation of Prior Art and Ex Parte Reexamination of Patents
A third-party requester who files a reexamination request may subsequently withdraw the request and receive a partial refund if the examiner has not yet made a determination on the request.,False,"According to MPEP 2213 and 2214, once a request for reexamination has been filed, the request itself cannot be withdrawn by the requester under any circumstances. The request becomes part of the official file and the reexamination proceeding must follow its statutory course. Furthermore, 37 CFR 1.26(c) only provides for refunds when reexamination is denied by the Director, not when a requester attempts to withdraw a pending request.",2200 - Citation of Prior Art and Ex Parte Reexamination of Patents
A request for ex parte reexamination can be properly based on evidence of prior public use or on-sale activities without supporting patents or printed publications.,False,"Reexamination is strictly limited by statute to patents and printed publications as stated in 35 USC 302 and implemented in 37 CFR 1.510(a). The regulations explicitly require that the request be based on 'prior art consisting of patents or printed publications.' Other forms of prior art, such as public use, on-sale activities, or non-publication evidence cannot form the basis for reexamination. This is a fundamental limitation of the reexamination process that distinguishes it from other post-grant proceedings.",2200 - Citation of Prior Art and Ex Parte Reexamination of Patents
"If a patent owner fails to respond to the first Office action in a reexamination proceeding within the two-month period, the patent will be treated as abandoned in the same manner as a non-responsive application.",False,"In reexamination proceedings, failure to respond to an Office action does not result in 'abandonment' as with regular applications. Instead, under 37 CFR 1.550(d), the examiner proceeds with the reexamination without the patent owner's input, which may result in claim cancellation or confirmation. The patent itself is not abandoned; rather, the owner's right to participate in that stage of the proceeding is forfeited. This reflects the public interest in resolving patentability questions even without owner participation.",2200 - Citation of Prior Art and Ex Parte Reexamination of Patents
A substantial new question of patentability must be based on a new interpretation of the prior art that was not previously considered by the Office during the original examination or any earlier reexamination of the patent.,True,"Under 35 USC 303(a) and MPEP 2242, a substantial new question of patentability requires that the prior art presents a new, non-cumulative technological teaching that was not previously considered or addressed in the earlier examination. If the same question of patentability was already decided during original examination or a prior reexamination, it cannot qualify as a 'substantial new question' even if the prior art reference itself was considered. The interpretation or application of the reference must raise a new issue for reexamination to be ordered.",2200 - Citation of Prior Art and Ex Parte Reexamination of Patents
"Once an ex parte reexamination has been instituted, the third-party requester has no further participation rights in the proceedings.",True,"Unlike inter partes proceedings, ex parte reexamination under 35 USC 302 explicitly limits third-party participation. According to MPEP 2282, after the request is filed, the third-party requester has no right to submit any further papers or participate in interviews, appeal proceedings, or any other aspect of the examination. This absence of continued participation rights is a defining characteristic of ex parte reexamination that distinguishes it from inter partes review.",2200 - Citation of Prior Art and Ex Parte Reexamination of Patents
Claims amended or added during reexamination are entitled to the same presumption of validity as original patent claims that survive reexamination without amendment.,False,"Under 35 U.S.C. 307(b) and the policies discussed in MPEP Chapter 2290, claims that are amended or added during reexamination do not enjoy the same presumption of validity as original claims that survive the reexamination without change. Specifically, amended and new claims are entitled to enforceability only from the date the reexamination certificate is issued, and the intervening rights provisions apply to these claims. This distinguishes their legal status from original unamended claims, which retain the presumption of validity from the original patent issuance date.",2200 - Citation of Prior Art and Ex Parte Reexamination of Patents
A PCT application can be filed at the USPTO as a receiving office regardless of the nationality or residence of the applicant.,False,"Under PCT Article 9(1) and PCT Rule 19.1, the USPTO can only serve as a receiving office for applicants who are nationals or residents of the United States. At least one of the applicants must be a US citizen or resident; otherwise, the application must be filed with another competent receiving office or the International Bureau. This ensures that receiving offices have appropriate jurisdiction over the applicants filing through them.",1800 - Patent Cooperation Treaty
A PCT application can claim priority from an earlier national application under the Paris Convention.,True,"Per PCT Article 8 and PCT Rule 4.10, a PCT application can claim priority from an earlier national or regional application filed in any Paris Convention member country within 12 months of the PCT filing. The PCT application functions as a subsequent application for Paris Convention purposes, not as a priority document itself. Applicants must make this priority claim at the time of filing or within 16 months from the priority date.",1800 - Patent Cooperation Treaty
The identification of at least one applicant is a mandatory requirement to secure an international filing date for a PCT application.,True,"Under PCT Article 11(1)(iii)(c), identification of the applicant is one of the mandatory requirements to secure an international filing date. Without this information, the receiving office will not accord a filing date to the application. This differs from the pre-AIA US practice where inventors were required to be identified, as under PCT rules, the 'applicant' can be the assignee or other legal representative rather than the inventor.",1800 - Patent Cooperation Treaty
A foreign filing license is not required before forwarding a PCT application filed at the USPTO to the International Bureau if the invention was made in the United States.,False,"Under 35 U.S.C. 184 and 37 CFR 5.11, a foreign filing license is required before filing a patent application in a foreign country or forwarding an international application abroad if the invention was made in the United States. Filing a PCT application at the USPTO as Receiving Office is a domestic filing and does not in itself require a foreign filing license, but before the application can be forwarded to the International Bureau (which is outside the United States) or any foreign patent office, an explicit or implicit foreign filing license must be obtained. This requirement applies regardless of the applicant's nationality.",1800 - Patent Cooperation Treaty
The USPTO's Express Mail procedure (Priority Mail Express) can be used to establish a filing date for a PCT application.,True,"The Priority Mail Express® service (formerly Express Mail) under 37 CFR 1.10 can be used to establish a filing date for PCT applications filed with the USPTO as receiving office. Under MPEP 1834, the 'date in' or mailing date is considered the international filing date if the application would otherwise be entitled to one. This provides applicants with a reliable method to secure a filing date even when the USPTO is not physically open for business.",1800 - Patent Cooperation Treaty
"The International Bureau, not the receiving office, is responsible for determining whether a PCT application meets all formal requirements for according an international filing date.",False,"Under PCT Article 11, it is the receiving office (such as the USPTO), not the International Bureau, that determines whether a PCT application meets the requirements for according an international filing date. The receiving office checks if the application contains: an indication that it is intended as an international application, designation of at least one contracting state, identification of at least one applicant, a description, and at least one claim. Only after according a filing date does the receiving office forward copies to the International Bureau.",1800 - Patent Cooperation Treaty
A PCT application must include the designation of specific countries in order to preserve the applicant's rights to later enter the national phase in those countries.,False,"Since January 1, 2004, under PCT Rule 4.9(a), filing a PCT application automatically constitutes the designation of all PCT contracting states bound by the PCT on the international filing date. This 'all-inclusive' designation system eliminated the previous requirement to specifically designate countries. The application automatically preserves the applicant's right to enter the national phase in any PCT member state, simplifying the filing process and eliminating potential mistakes in country designation.",1800 - Patent Cooperation Treaty
"To establish a filing date for a PCT application, all formal requirements including payment of fees must be satisfied at the time of filing.",False,"Per PCT Article 11, payment of fees is not among the requirements for securing an international filing date. The required elements are: an indication the application is intended as international, designation of at least one contracting state, identification of the applicant, a description, and at least one claim. Fees can be paid later, typically within one month of notification by the receiving office, although late payment may incur additional charges. This allows applicants to secure a critical filing date even if fee payment is temporarily delayed.",1800 - Patent Cooperation Treaty
The USPTO can act as an International Searching Authority for PCT applications even if it did not serve as the receiving office for those applications.,True,"Under PCT Article 16 and PCT Rule 35, the USPTO can act as an International Searching Authority (ISA) for PCT applications filed with other receiving offices, provided the applicant chooses the USPTO as the ISA and the receiving office specifies the USPTO as a competent ISA. This allows applicants to benefit from USPTO examination expertise even when filing through a different receiving office, though there may be restrictions based on the language of filing and competency agreements between offices.",1800 - Patent Cooperation Treaty
Jurisdiction over an appeal to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board transfers to the Board upon the filing of a notice of appeal by the applicant.,False,"Under 37 CFR 41.35(a), jurisdiction over the appeal does not pass to the Board upon filing a notice of appeal or even an appeal brief. Rather, jurisdiction transfers to the Board only after the filing of a reply brief (or expiration of the time to file one) and completion of the examiner's answer. Before this point, the examiner retains authority over the application, which allows for the possibility of reopening prosecution or allowing the application based on amendments or arguments in the appeal brief.",1200 - Appeal
"When the Board enters a new ground of rejection in its decision, the appellant has the option to either request rehearing before the Board or reopen prosecution before the examiner.",True,"According to 37 CFR 41.50(b) and MPEP 1214.01, when the Board designates a new ground of rejection in its decision, the appellant has two options: (1) submit an amendment and/or new evidence to reopen prosecution before the examiner, or (2) request rehearing before the Board. The regulation explicitly provides these two alternative courses of action, contrary to the incorrect statement that reopening prosecution is not permitted.",1200 - Appeal
"A patent owner may file a request for supplemental examination to have the Office consider information not previously considered during examination, but this procedure cannot be used to correct issues with the claims or specification.",False,"Under 35 USC 257 and MPEP 2802, supplemental examination can be requested by a patent owner to consider, reconsider, or correct information believed to be relevant to the patent. While the procedure primarily addresses prior art issues, it can be used to address any issue that may render the patent invalid, including issues under 35 USC 112 related to the claims or specification. The only limitation is that amendments to the patent are not permitted during supplemental examination itself, though they may be made in any resulting reexamination.",2800 - Supplemental Examination
A preissuance submission by a third party under 35 U.S.C. 122(e) is permitted in a reissue application.,False,"Per 35 USC 122(e)(2)(A) and MPEP 1134, preissuance submissions are expressly prohibited in reissue applications. The statute specifically limits such submissions to 'an application for a patent,' which under USPTO interpretation excludes reissue applications. This prohibition exists because reissue applications involve already-granted patents, and other mechanisms such as ex parte reexamination are available for third parties to submit prior art relevant to issued patents.",1100 - Statutory Invention Registration (SIR); Pre-Grant Publication (PGPub)

While the America Invents Act (AIA) expanded the third-party submission program effective September 16, 2012, the provision applies to applications filed both before and after this date, as long as they were pending as of, or filed after, the effective date of the AIA provision.",1100 - Statutory Invention Registration (SIR); Pre-Grant Publication (PGPub)
A provisional obviousness-type double patenting rejection can be made even between applications with no common inventors if the applications are commonly owned or subject to a joint research agreement.,True,"Per MPEP 804, a provisional double patenting rejection can be made even when there are no common inventors between two applications, provided the applications are commonly owned or are subject to a joint research agreement as defined by 35 USC 102(c). This prevents an entity from obtaining multiple patents on obvious variations of the same invention, which could effectively extend patent term, regardless of whether the same inventors are named on the applications.",0800 - Restriction in Applications Filed Under 35 U.S.C. 111; Double Patenting
"If the examiner issues a new ground of rejection in an Examiner's Answer, the appellant is required to file a reply brief to maintain the appeal.",False,"According to 37 CFR 41.39(b) and MPEP 1207.03, when the examiner designates a new ground of rejection in an Examiner's Answer, the appellant has two options: (1) request that prosecution be reopened by filing an amendment and/or new evidence, or (2) file a reply brief responding to the new ground. Filing a reply brief is not mandatory - the appellant can choose either option. If the appellant chooses not to exercise either option, the appeal will proceed to the Board based on the existing record.",1200 - Appeal
"The Board may, in its discretion, enter a new ground of rejection in order to address a new issue that was not raised by the examiner but is clearly relevant to patentability.",True,"Per 37 CFR 41.50(b) and MPEP 1213.02, the Board has the authority to enter a new ground of rejection when a new issue is discovered that was not raised by the examiner but is clearly relevant to patentability. This authority ensures that the patent system functions properly by allowing the Board to address patentability issues that may have been overlooked, even if it disadvantages the appellant by raising a rejection not previously encountered during prosecution.",1200 - Appeal
An obviousness-type double patenting rejection is the only proper basis for a provisional double patenting rejection between copending applications.,False,"According to MPEP 804, provisional double patenting rejections can be based on either statutory double patenting (same invention under 35 USC 101) or obviousness-type double patenting (non-statutory). Both types of rejections can apply to copending applications that have not yet issued as patents. The key difference is that statutory double patenting rejections require identical claims, while obviousness-type rejections apply when the claims are not identical but are not patentably distinct.",0800 - Restriction in Applications Filed Under 35 U.S.C. 111; Double Patenting
"When filing a preissuance submission under 35 USC 122(e), a third party must provide a concise description of the relevance of each submitted document, regardless of whether the document is in English or a foreign language.",True,"Under 37 CFR 1.290(d)(2) and MPEP 1134, a third-party submission must include a 'concise description of the asserted relevance of each item identified.' This requirement applies to all submitted documents, whether they are in English or a foreign language.

"When the USPTO determines that a substantial new question of patentability exists at the conclusion of a supplemental examination, an ex parte reexamination is automatically ordered.",True,"Per 37 CFR 1.625(a)(2) and MPEP 2644, if the Office determines that a substantial new question of patentability (SNQ) is raised by at least one item of information in the request, the supplemental examination certificate will indicate this finding and an ex parte reexamination will be ordered. This automatic initiation of reexamination distinguishes supplemental examination from other patent review procedures where separate petitions might be required.",2800 - Supplemental Examination
An ex parte reexamination ordered as a result of a supplemental examination is limited to considering only patents and printed publications as a basis for rejection.,False,"Unlike a standard ex parte reexamination, which is limited to patents and printed publications under 35 USC 302, reexamination resulting from supplemental examination may consider any patentability issue raised by the items of information in the request, as specified in 37 CFR 1.625(d)(2).

A third party may file a request for supplemental examination of an issued patent to have the Office consider information not previously considered during examination.,False,"Under 35 USC 257(a) and MPEP 2812, only a patent owner may file a request for supplemental examination. This contrasts with ex parte reexamination, which can be requested by anyone including third parties. The limitation to patent owners reflects the purpose of supplemental examination as a mechanism for patent owners to potentially immunize their patents against allegations of inequitable conduct based on information not previously considered.",2800 - Supplemental Examination
"If a substantial new question of patentability is found in supplemental examination based on a 35 USC 112 issue, the subsequent ex parte reexamination will be limited to considering only patents and printed publications related to that issue.",False,"According to 37 CFR 1.625(d)(2) and MPEP 2816.03, the ex parte reexamination ordered from a supplemental examination is not limited to patents and printed publications, nor is it limited only to the issues identified in the request. The scope includes any substantial new question of patentability, which may include issues under 35 USC 101, 102, 103, or 112. This broader scope distinguishes it from regular ex parte reexamination.",2800 - Supplemental Examination
A patent owner can amend claims during the supplemental examination proceeding before the ex parte reexamination is ordered.,False,"Under 37 CFR 1.620(f) and MPEP 2816.02, amendments to the patent may not be filed in a supplemental examination proceeding. The patent owner can only submit amendments after an ex parte reexamination is ordered, as part of the reexamination proceeding, not during the supplemental examination itself. This reflects the limited, non-adversarial nature of supplemental examination as a preliminary consideration of information.",2800 - Supplemental Examination
A request for supplemental examination must explicitly identify issues of patentability that may be raised by the submitted information.,True,"Per 37 CFR 1.610(b)(5) and MPEP 2811.01, the request must include an identification of each item of information that raises a question of patentability and an explanation of how each item raises a substantial new question of patentability. The patent owner cannot simply submit information without explaining its relevance to patentability, as the Office must determine whether a substantial new question exists based on the patent owner's identification and explanation.",2800 - Supplemental Examination
"An ex parte reexamination that results from a supplemental examination request will consider any substantial new question of patentability, even if it is based on issues not identified in the initial request.",True,"According to 37 CFR 1.625(d)(2) and MPEP 2816.03, once ordered, the ex parte reexamination is not limited to the issues identified in the supplemental examination request. Any substantial new question of patentability can be addressed, whether identified in the initial request or discovered during the reexamination proceeding. This ensures comprehensive examination of all potential patentability issues once reexamination begins.",2800 - Supplemental Examination
"When a substantial new question of patentability is found during supplemental examination based on inequitable conduct, the Office will order both an ex parte reexamination and a separate proceeding to determine enforceability.",False,"Per 35 USC 257(b) and MPEP 2816.03, while the Office will consider potential unpatentability issues in the resulting ex parte reexamination, the supplemental examination proceeding itself cannot address issues of enforceability or inequitable conduct. Inequitable conduct is an equitable defense handled by the courts, not the USPTO. Supplemental examination is designed to immunize patents against later findings of inequitable conduct, not to determine whether such conduct occurred.",2800 - Supplemental Examination
A patent owner must pay both the supplemental examination fee and the ex parte reexamination fee when filing a request for supplemental examination.,True,"Under 37 CFR 1.610(a) and MPEP 2812.02, the patent owner must pay both the supplemental examination fee and the ex parte reexamination fee at the time of filing the request. The reexamination fee will be refunded if the Office determines that no substantial new question of patentability is raised and thus no reexamination is ordered. This combined fee requirement ensures resources are allocated for both phases of the process.",2800 - Supplemental Examination
A patent owner who fails to address all items of information in a supplemental examination request will have the request denied without a refund of fees.,True,"Per 37 CFR 1.610(d) and MPEP 2812.01, if the request does not comply with the requirements, including identification and explanation of each item of information, the Office will notify the patent owner of the defects and provide a single opportunity to correct them within a set time period. If the patent owner fails to comply, the request will be denied and the fees will not be refunded.

These reasons must include an explanation as to why any amendments or arguments overcome the previously applied rejections. This requirement ensures a complete prosecution record explaining why the claim was allowed, which is important for both the patent owner and the public.",2200 - Citation of Prior Art and Ex Parte Reexamination of Patents
A patent owner may amend claims during ex parte reexamination to enlarge their scope if the amendment is supported by the original disclosure.,False,"According to 35 USC 305 and MPEP 2258.05, no proposed amended or new claim in a reexamination proceeding may enlarge the scope of the claims of the patent. This prohibition applies even if the amendment is fully supported by the original disclosure. The policy prevents patent owners from capturing subject matter they could have claimed but chose not to claim during original prosecution, potentially affecting competitors who may have designed around the original claims.",2200 - Citation of Prior Art and Ex Parte Reexamination of Patents
The Director of the USPTO has discretion to merge multiple pending ex parte reexamination proceedings that involve the same patent.,True,"Under 37 CFR 1.565(c) and MPEP 2283, when multiple reexamination proceedings are pending concurrently for the same patent, the Director may merge them. This consolidation promotes efficiency, prevents duplicative effort, and avoids potentially conflicting decisions. Merging typically occurs before an Action on the merits is issued in the later-filed reexamination, but may occur at any time during the reexamination proceedings at the Director's discretion.",2200 - Citation of Prior Art and Ex Parte Reexamination of Patents
A patent owner must pay an issue fee at the conclusion of an ex parte reexamination proceeding in order for the reexamination certificate to be issued.,False,"Unlike regular patent applications, there is no issue fee required for ex parte reexamination under 37 CFR 1.20. Once the Notice of Intent to Issue Reexamination Certificate (NIRC) is issued, the reexamination certificate will be issued without any additional fee payment from the patent owner.

A third-party requester in an ex parte reexamination has the right to appeal the examiner's decision not to adopt a proposed rejection.,False,"Under 35 USC 305 and MPEP 2273, in ex parte reexamination, the third-party requester's participation ends after filing the initial request. Unlike inter partes reexamination or inter partes review, the third-party has no right to appeal, petition, or otherwise participate in the examination process after the request is filed. This limitation reflects the ex parte nature of the proceeding, which is primarily between the patent owner and the USPTO.",2200 - Citation of Prior Art and Ex Parte Reexamination of Patents
The scope of ex parte reexamination is limited to new questions of patentability based on patents or printed publications.,True,"Per 35 USC 302 and MPEP 2258, ex parte reexamination is strictly limited to consideration of prior art patents and printed publications.

"A claim in an application states 'a pH range between 7 and 12, preferably between 9 and 10.' This claim is indefinite under 35 USC § 112(b) because it contains a broad range and a narrower preferred range within the same claim.",True,A broad range together with a narrower range in the same claim creates indefiniteness under 35 USC § 112(b).

"Under the KSR decision, applying a gas spring from a Murphy bed design to assist in lifting the heavy tread of a treadmill would be considered obvious, even without an explicit teaching to combine these technologies.",True,"This scenario represents a straightforward application of KSR's rationales for obviousness. Using a gas spring from one heavy folding mechanism (Murphy bed) to assist with another heavy folding mechanism (treadmill) represents the application of a known technique to a similar device to yield predictable results. Both devices share the common problem of needing assistance to move heavy components, making the solution obvious even without explicit teaching to combine.",2100 - Patentability
A reference that teaches away from a claimed invention can still be used to establish a prima facie case of obviousness under 35 USC § 103.,False,"A reference that teaches away from the claimed invention (i.e., suggests that the invention would not work or should not be attempted) actually provides evidence against obviousness.

"A patent claim that recites 'a method of manufacturing widgets comprising the steps of: heating, cooling, and shaping' would cover a method that includes the additional step of polishing between cooling and shaping.",True,"The transitional phrase 'comprising' in a method claim allows for additional, unrecited steps. The claim requires heating, cooling, and shaping, but does not exclude additional steps such as polishing.
